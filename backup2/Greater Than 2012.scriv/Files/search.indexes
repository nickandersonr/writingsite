	A ways behind Peter in line a child began to sing.  Worn down by a long day of shopping, he began a personal improv game of singing the  things he saw around him.  The song is different each time, but this one went like this:
	
	There’s a reeeeed chair, a big red chair
	Aaaaaand a table and a dress shirt . . . Over there!

The boy shot a surprised smile at his mother over this little rhyme he had concocted so effortlessly.  She smiled dissaprovingly.  “Not too loud, ok?”

	A woman wearin a dress and a boy in shorts,
	He's kinda tall and he looks like - 

“No people.” His mother reminded him, placing a hand firmly on his head.

	Peter’s ears was burning.  What rhymes with shorts?

	The Goodwill in Peter’s town in much like the one in yours.  There’s a rack of men's suitcoats by the door, a labrynth of used furniture where college roomattes argue over the dimensions of door frames, a housewares section where young newlyweds search for matching mugs without chips.  In fact, if you were standing behind him in line, you may be inclined to think that you were in your town.  There would be only one major difference - the things on the racks of your Goodwill are from the lives of the people in your town; the things on the racks around Peter are from the lives of the people in his town.  At first thought that might seem a trivial distinction, but I assure you, it is not.
	Peter studied the pair of used gloves in his hands.  They were absolutely perfect.  Dried dirt still filled the wrinkles and crevices formed by someone else’s hands; even when held flat in front of him the fingers clutched an invisible garden tool, a permanent hook worn by someone else’s labor.  This was a prime selling point - he needed to look like he knew what he was doing, like this was not his first time working outside.  The gloves, he was convinced, were all the camoflauge one needed.  
	Peter’s stomach rumbled unhappily.  It was taking longer than Peter had expected to check out.  The store bustled for a Friday afternoon - mainly parents and children, a few elderly, but no one near his age.  He knew this to be the last day of classes for high school, and as far as college, Peter had never gotten far enough to know when they were let out.  He had done nothing in the year since he had graduated high school.  Not nothing, obviously - he passed his time going to the gym, shopping at Goodwill, driving his car around his increasingly familiar city.  But that was about it.  Peter could have written his plans for the week on a post-it - it would have read “Gloves, hamburger”.	

	In the parking lot Peter attempted to get his bag and body into his car without touching any of the hot surfaces, like a reverse game of Operation.  The car, a Daewoo Lanos, sat so close to the ground on its tiny wheels that he was forced to more or less fall into the open door.  He felt silly inside the car.  It was a small green hatchback, resembling a Spearmint tic-tac on wheels; it was ten years old, out of production, unrepairable, and above all, extremely ridiculous looking.  Perhaps the only positive was that whoever had owned it first had not seemed to care much for blarring loud music - the speakers sang clearly.
	Peter scanned the parking lot pensively - still, no one near his age.  He relaxed, rolled the windows down, and turned the volume knob up slowly - 
	Why do you build me up - 
	Buttercup baby, just to let me down
	And mess me around

	He nodded his head happily as the wheels rolled into motion.  Time for stop two of the day.  Not far from the Goodwill was Hamburger Stand  - a dirt cheap alternative to conventional food situated across the street from a strip club.  Today the casual dining experience was enhanced by a car wash taking place across the street - half a dozen bikini-clad women wielding cartoon-sized sponges took turns half-heatedly wiping down cars as three or more stood at the corner, wringing water out over themselves dramatically.  When Peter walked in, the entire male populace sat facing the window, some squinting through vinyl stickers of hot dogs to make out the seductive shapes at work.  At the counter a man struggled to order with one eye transfixed at the scene outside.  “Yeah, I’ll have the uh . . . do you guys still have the, uh . . .”
	Peter’s eyes lit up when he saw the jukebox in the corner.  “Wow,” he expressed loudly to himself, “Does that - I wonder if it works.”  He jangled about eight dollars worth of quarters in his pocket as he approached the machine.  “Wow, look at all this old music.  I wonder if I have any change.”
	He did this almost ever Saturday.  And while the the process was becoming more streamlined for him - B7, A3, D4, A2 - it was becoming increasingly confusing behavoir to the people who worked the weekend shifts at Hamburger Stand.  “It’s that guy . . .”, they whispered to eachother as he sunk quarter after quarter into the machine, his fingers rehersing familiar choreography on the glowing plastic buttons.
	Sitting down to the the first snare hit of “Blue Days, Black Nights”, Peter engrossed himself fully in his burger, in a corner facing the jukebox.  Those speakers worked pretty well too.  With his two major tasks for the week out of the way, Peter was finally able to relax.

            <Text>Chapter 1 - Gloves from Goodwill

	The Goodwill in Peter�s town in much like the one in yours.  There�s the rack of men's suitcoats by the door, the labrynth of used furniture where college roomattes argue over the dimensions of their door frames, a housewares section where young newlyweds search for matching mugs without chips.  In fact, if you were standing behind him in line, you may be inclined to think that you were in your town.  There would be only one major difference - the things on the racks of your Goodwill are from the lives of the people in your town; the things on the racks around Peter are from the lives of the people in his town.  This may seem like a small detail now, but it will become increasingly important; this is why I felt I needed to explain it to you first.
	Peter studied the pair of used gloves in his hands.  They were absolutely perfect.  Dried dirt still filled the wrinkles and crevices formed by someone else�s hands; even when held flat in front of him the fingers clutched an invisible garden tool, a permanent hook worn by someone else�s labor.  This was a prime selling point - he needed to look like he knew what he was doing, like this was not his first time working outside.  The gloves, he was convinced, were all the camoflauge one needed.  Whether he would actually know what to do  - well, there was nothing he could do about that.  He hoped the confidance the gloves would give him would be enough.
	The store bustled for a Friday afternoon.  Mainly parents and children, a few elderly, but no one near his age.  He knew this to be the last day of classes for high school, and as far as college, Peter had never gotten far enough to know when they were let out.  He had done nothing in the year since he had graduated high school - not nothing, obviously - he passed his time going to the gym, shopping at Goodwill, driving his car around his increasingly familiar city.  But that was about it.  Peter could have written his plans for the week on a post-it - it would have read �Gloves, hamburger�.
	A cool peace filled the Goodwill, thanks in no small part to the industrial air conditioner blowing cool whispers onto the linoleum, a sharp contrast to the heat that pummeled the ground outside.  June 13th, and already all fantasies of beaches and picnics had given way to the familiar realization that summer could be just as unpleasant as winter.  But not inside Goodwill, no, with that giant Kenmore belting out comfort.
	A ways behind Peter in line a child began to sing.  Worn down by a long day of shopping, he began a personal improv game of singing the  things he saw around him.  The song is different each time, but this one went like this:
	
	There�s a reeeeed chair, a big red chair

	In the parking lot Peter attempted to get his bag and body into his car without touching any of the hot surfaces, like a reverse game of Operation.  The car, a Daewoo Lanos, sat so close to the ground on its tiny wheels that many of the heat-avoidance manuevers resembled dives in slow motion - arms first, arched back, no splash.  He felt silly inside the car.  It was a small green hatchback, resembling a Spearmint tic-tac on wheels; it was ten years old, out of production, unrepairable, and above all, extremely ridiculous looking.  Perhaps the only positive was that whoever had owned it first had not seemed to care much for blarring loud music.  The speakers sang clearly.

            <Text>	
	It was mid afternoon when Peter entered his dark house - he stood quitely at the door for a few minutes, listening for noise.  He had opened the curtains in the morning, but they had been shut again - only thin kinves of light cut across the carpet, illuminating small slivers of couch, door, kitchen.  Slowly his eyes adjusted to reveal an empty room.  Peter sighed.  
	He set his keys on the kitchen counter, beside a half-closed box of pancake mix, and a stove top that still radiated heat.  Knew it.  The hallway was still too dark to see down, but Peter groped the wall as he made his way to Paul�s door.
	�Paul?�  Peter knocked softly on the door, then a bit louder.  �Paul, are you in there?�
	This was a rhetorical question, as there was little evidence pointing otherwise.  Still Paul remained silent.  Reluctantly Peter entered his room and crawled under his bed.
	When the house had been built - failry recently I believe - the original owner had had some plan with these rooms that was still a mystery to the two boys.  At the base of the wall the rooms shared was a small cutout, like a permanent doggie door.  When they'd been younger it had been easier to fit through; now Peter could get in to about his shoulders.  In the next room all Peter could make out was the boxspring that hovered over him, and some clothes on the floor in the distance.
	�Paul,� Peter called to the underside of his bed.  �Come talk to me.�
	The springs above his head groaned softly.
	�Not even on the last day of school, Paul?�
	�. . . No.� a voice answered softly.
	�Didn�t you want to say goodbye to - well didn�t you have to be there?�
	�No,� said the voice, muffled by more bed springs, �Half day.  We don�t do anything.�
	�Did you - go enough this year?  You were close to -�
	�Yeah, I passed.  I�ll be a senior next year.�
	�Ok well that�s good, but,� Peter turned from his stomach to his back in the cramped opening, �What about the girl?  Rebekkah?�
	�I'm not going.�
	�You said yesterday you might.�
	�Yeah, I said I might.�
	�And so you�re not?�
	�I�m not.�
	�Well that�s too bad because,� Peter groped for the shopping bag behind him, �I got you some gloves.  They look so legit.�  He half-tossed them through the opening, onto the pile of clothes beside Paul�s bed.  
	�I didn�t -�
	�I know, you just said you wouldn�t know what to do if you went, so I thought this would help.  No one�s going to know what they're doing any more than you.  Listen ok you�ll be totally, completely fine.�
	There was still no movement from above.
	�I really enjoyed talking to you last night, you know.  About Rebekkah and stuff.  You maybe want to do that again tonight?�
	�. . . You just want me to cook you food.�  There was a hint of a smile in his voice.
	�Hey, I�ll order a pizza.  Whatever.�
	Slowly a pale, slender arm descended off the side of the bed, and pulled the gloves up off the floor.  �I never should have told you her name.�
	�Or that she�s cute.�
	�That�s seriously all I know about her.�  Peter could hear Paul turning over the gloves in his hands.  �I don't want to do this.�
	�Yeah, but you should.�
	�I went to school almost every day this week.�
	�One more isn�t going to kill you.�
	�I have to be there at eight.�
	�I�ll drive you.�
	�You�re not going to wake up late are you?  Make me look stuipid?�
	�ONE TIME.�  Peter reminded him.  �And don�t lie, we had fun that day anyway.  Better than if we�d gone in, right?�
	�Yeah, yeah, maybe.  But you totally did that on purpose.�
	Peter�s neck was begining to ache from the angle it was turned at, but Paul kept talking, so Peter stayed.

            <Title>Chapter 3 - Gardening</Title>
            <Text>	Paul�s room has one window - it had been augmented with a towel and a down comforter to block out as much light as possible, but what did filter in was recognizable as the light-blue hue of early dawn.
	Id pattered his way around the bed, mewing quietly and pressing his face into Paul�s ear to purr loudly.  The cat's cold nosed forced him into consciousness, a sharp contrast to the warm morning that felt somehow indimidating.  In the sleepfulness of the morning he had forgotten the promises he had made the night before, and now as they came trickling back he felt his stomach sink and a hot buzz begining in his head, an uncomfortable-ness that plauged his entire body with a manic itch caused him to sit up and catch his breath.
	Seven hours, he told himself.  By three o�clock you�ll be home.  
	Paul threw the corner of the comforter and towel over the curtain rack, allowing just a slice of light to illuminate his open closet.  Everything he owned was plain and functional - sweats, tshirts, dilapadated jeans; nothing really suited for gardening.  Still he dug through the piles that had collected beneath the empty hangers, hoping that some abberation waited for him at the bottom.
	He stood back, and looked himself in the mirror.  He wondered if Peter would have the same messy, loose curls that he did if he let his hair grow out.  Paul wasn�t a huge fan of the military-esque buzz that Peter kept, but he could see why he did it - several months without maintenance left his hair piled haphazaardly upon his head, falling leftward and into his face just a bit.  The plain grey shirt he had picked out had a giant diagonal crease down the front from sitting beneath the pile of clothes in his closet, but this was ok.  Paul looked himself in the eye and repeated:
	You will never see these people again after today.

	Paul had not known Rebekkah before two days ago - he had passed her in the hallways at school, sure, still he knew her only as a component of a whole, the way he knew the few hundred others that he shared classrooms with.  She was damn pretty.  In a natural way - her straight brown hair looked good when she did nothing to it, her eyes were alluring because they were always glossed in wonder and sanguity.  It was not the proper application of makeup but that glow that made her look completed; even in baggy sweats, even on off days.  Paul had noticed all this, from afar, but this was nothing new.  There were pretty girls everywhere, girls that were pretty for a variety of reasons.  The part that moved Paul, as he had explained it to Peter, had nothing to do with appearance.
	�No one, ever?� Peter had asked.
	�Well, no.� he�d replied, �But that doesn�t really bother me.  I like being left alone.�
	�So when she came up to you - that was the first time someone tried to talk to you, since . . .?�
	�Since I can remember, I guess.  Everyone knows I don�t talk to people.�
	�Does Rebekkah know that?�
	�She�d had to�ve.�
	�Then why did she come talk to you?�
	�I don�t know why.�

	Paul stood at the stove in the dark kitchen, heating a skillet.  As he stirred the bowl of pancake batter he replayed the conversation he and Rebekkah had shared, pulling up the corners of it, looking for hidden meaning.  
	There had been a few dozen people in the hallway at the time - socializing, rummaging through lockers . . . but she had come directly to him.  
	She had seemed - not desperate.  Genuine, maybe.
	�Hey, how�s it going?� she had said, a friendly bounce in her voice.
	�Gooood.� Paul had replied, confused.  The greeting was just familiar enough to make him question whether he had been mistaken for someone else.  
	�Sorry, I don�t think we really know eachother - I�m Rebekkah!  Didn�t we have, like, Spanish together or something?�
	�Ah, I don�t know, maybe.�  They definitely had.  He had spent a considerable ammount of time pretending not to be starring at her and her friends - a grouping of four or five similarly attractive girls in the back corner of the classroom.  He was pretty sure they had caught on eventually, had started facing away from him intentionally to show that his surveilance was not appreciated.  If he�d ever said anything, to any of them, maybe the admiration would have come off a little more endearing, or maybe he would feel less inclined to stare, having finally made verbal contact with them but - that had been the year before, and he was glad that, at least superficially, any previous encounters had been scrubbed from the record.  
	�Well, we�re planting a garden in the lot behind the cafeteria over the summer.  Anything we grow is going to be donated to the food pantry downtown.  A-S-S-U-M-I-N-G we actually grow anything, which is hard to say at this point, have you seen the back patio?  I know they�re still in the middle of clearing it but its really hard to imagine anything growing there right now!�
	�Yeah,� Paul bobbed his head along to the syncopation of the conversation.  He was so focused on remaining an active participant that he found it hard to hear what she was saying.  
	�Aaaaanyway,� she continued, swaying slowly from foot to foot, �Eight to three, lunch provided.  Though, you could totally bring a snack or something, I think we're just bringing PB&amp;Js, and those little bags of chips?  Probably koolaid or something, I'm not sure.  Sooo yeah, maybe I�ll see ya there?�
	�Yeah, maybe!�  Paul funneled the anxiety into a sort of feigned excitement - happy, but noncommital.  
	�Ok great!�  And with this she smiled, pivoted, and walked away as casually as she had approached.

	Peter burst through his bedroom door.
	�We're not running late, are we?!�  He knew they were running late.  Paul placed his dishes into the dishwasher as Peter scoured the counter frantically for his keys.
	�I am not going to fuck this up for you.�
	�There�s nothing to fuck up.�
	�Well I don't want them to wait for you.�
	�They're not going to, no one even knows if I'm going.�
	�Rebekkah-� Peter began to say, then stopped himself.  �No pressure, I'm just saying, let�s show this girl you can show up places on time.�
	As Peter started his car, hardcore began to crackle angrily out of the cold speakers.  Paul entered the car head last, motioning for Peter to turn it down before he was all the way inside.
	�How do you listen to that shitty metal all the time?  Isn�t it giving you brain damage?�
	�Hell no.  This is the only kind of music I like.  Just so - raw, do you not feel it?  Great lifting music.�
	�You are such a douche sometimes.�
	�What? Just cause I like metal and got some meat on my bones?  You can say what you want, the ladies dig guys that are in shape like this.�
	�I haven�t seen you with a girl since high school.�  A sudden pang of fear hit Paul.  �Why am I even taking advice from you?�
	�Would you RELAX?�  Peter turned the volume knob down until it clicked off.  �The only advice you�re taking from me so far, is seeing this girl again.  That�s it.  Anyone would tell you that much.  The rest, just figure it out as you go.�
	Paul could not decide if this was better or worse advice.
	�You know, its really - just, its good to see you.  Like, up and dressed, going out.  This has been a good week for that.  I really just -�
	�Shut up.�  
	Paul was serious.  Peter knew not to push it.  

	The garden Rebekkah had spoken about was at the center of a large courtyard that hung off the back of their school.  It opened up to a neighborhood on the south side, and had never been very well kept.  Now the overgrown patches of dirt were raked clean, and a dozen or so volunteers milled around the area on their hands and knees.  
	Pauld didn�t recognized a single one of them.  Not even as component of a whole.  These were completely new faces, not a single one of which had he ever seen at his school.
	Except for Rebekkah - she stood by an out-of-place rusty fold out table, presumably errected for the event.  On it sat a few dozen seed packets, some gardening tools, and a  few pairs of brand new, flimsy-looking gloves.  She was holding a bag of seeds up to a boy, motioning to the neat rows of dirt.
	�Yeah, about six inches apart - but you want to keep them straight, k?  See how we dug the row?�
	�Definitely, definitely - just - they could go anywhere, correct?�
	�What do you mean?�
	The boy surveyed the garden like long division, a subtle sort of excitement creeping up into him.  �If I plant them outside the rows, they'd still turn into plants, right?�
	He was hardly dressed for gardening - he wore a blue collared shirt, buttoned to the very top, and stiff navy blue pleated shorts.  His hair was plastered into a semi-solid state of neutrality, the kind of haircut seen on polititicians over fifty.  He rummaged through the seed packet with one hand.
	�One seed is - one plant, right?�
	�Y-yeah, I think that�s generally how it works.�
	Rebekkah caught the image of Paul out of the corner of her eye, and began to wave excitedly.
	�Paul!  Wow!  I wasn�t expecting to see you here!� she jangled up beside him, a packet of seeds and a pair of gloves in her hands.
	�Oh look at you!  Gloves and everything!  You got some seeds in those pockets too?�
	�Ohh, no, I didn�t - �
	�Oh no I�m kidding that would be . . . �
	Paul already felt ridiculous.  Every set of words that tumbled out of his mouth stung his lips painfully.  
	�Well luckily I have plenty of those.�  Rebekkah pulled a packet of carrot seeds from her back pocket.  They were warm with body heat in Paul's hand; the tiny envelope had sealed itself shut from the hummitidy of the day.  
	�Radishes!  Back wall - keep �em straight.  You see where we dug the rows?  Just start over by Jacob over there.� she pointed to the neat looking boy that�d been contimplating seeds a moment before.  �Oh shoot, I should have introduced you while you were both here.  You probably don't recognize anyone, huh?
	�Ah, no.�  Was that really a point of concern?
	�Yeah, these guys are from Calvary.  Homeschooled kids.  They do this thing,� she explained, �Where they make them all get together and interact with each other?  Like, they have group P.E. classes where they all play dodgeball.�
	Paul examined the kids in the garden, and it made sense - they seemed to vary in age slightly, and all had this sort of frightened look to them.  He imagined what sort of pathetic game of dodgeball was played between these people.  They averted their eyes when he looked at them.  It was a huge relief.
	�Alright well,� Rebekkah continued, �You get goin�, I�ll be comin� around with lots of water.  Drink lots of water!  If you pass out we�re leaving you there and using you as fertilizer.�
	�Ok.�  Paul began to walk to the back wall of the garden.
	�Paul!� Rebekkah called.  �That�s not true.  I shouldn�t say stuff like that.�
	Paul nodded.

	Well that went well.  Paul dug his spade into the hot, dry dirt that bit at his bare knees.  A girl a few rows down had giant kneepads.  Why hadn�t Peter thought of that?  He could already feel a sunburn starting on his neck.  If it was possible to garden bitterly, Paul was pulling it off quite well.  Rebekkah stood at the other side of the garden by the rusted table.  Paul felt silly for coming.  He had no actual desire to plant radishes.

	�You have to move faster if you want them all to sprout at the same time!�  
	The boy in the pleated shorts - Jacob - had planted his way up to the side of Paul.  Somewhere a few yards back his row had bent and b-lined to him, creating a giant arc through what was supposed to be rows of cabbage and arugula.  
	�You have to get them in there all about the same time, to make sure they all pop up at the same time; otherwise the watering�ll get off.�
	�I don�t think that�s how it works.� Paul replied, turning his shoulder against Jacob and attempting to plant faster.  Jacob picked up the pace as well, passing him until they both aimed their spade at the same patch of dirt.
	�Whattaya say?� Jacob propositioned.  �We both throw our seeds in, and see what they turn into?�
	Paul began digging backwards.  
	�Reverse!� Jacob called, digging adjacent holes along side him.
	At lunch, Jacob sat as close to Paul as was possible on a cement ledge beside the table.  
	�I�ll be honest, this is my first time gardening.� Jacob explained.  
	Rebekkah walked around handing out sandwiches, using the period of exhange to check in with the gardeners about their day.  �Things going well?� Paul could hear her ask.  �Need anything?�, and things also like �Yeah, I didn�t have anything better to do this weekend� and �That�s interesting, tell me about it.�
	Paul began concocting a mental list of possible conversation - then arranged them in order of relevancy and interest.  
	�Remember that time that I pointed to the bird on the fence?�  Jacob reminisced.
	� . . . Yes� Paul replied, his eyes still transfixed upon Rebekkah as she moved towards them with sandwiches.
	�I have a confession.  When you turned your head, I threw a carrot seed in with your radish seed.  Don�t worry, I remember exactly where.�
	Rebekkah handed a sandwich to Paul.
	� . . -�
	�We shall see Paul!  I still think there is hope for a Raddarrot of some kind; a hybrid, if you will.�
	Rebekkah smiled, and wrinkled her nose at what she percieved as two new friends sharing a moment over a PB&amp;J.  Quietly she slinked away as not to disturb the deep, meaningful conversation the two were having.  Paul briefly considered strangling Jacob, but as he was not prone to outward expression he simply sat there, listening to him ramble on and on in between the loudest chewing he could achieve.  
	The afternoon was hotter than the morning, and the strength the food gave Paul wore off quickly.  Jacob continued his one sided banter about gardening, nature, birds, and everything else that seemed to pass his eye line.
	�Ok so get this,� Jacob pushed some long strands of hair out of his eyes, that had come unglued from the rest of his head from sweat.  �So normally, plants and things, they grow everywhere.�
	Jacob offered some time for this to sink in, while Paul attempted to finish off the packet of seeds.  Eleven left.  Almost three o�clock.  Two thirty is close enough, right?
	�In a garden though, you pick and choose what you want to grow in it.  You don�t just let things grow, you make things grow, because you prefer them.  You see what I mean?�  Jacob pointed his spade at the four corners of the garden.  �You block it off, you put what you want in there.  And for a while its empty.  I bet people drive by this garden and think �Oh, what a waste of space.  No nature, no nothing.�  But they don�t know, something better than wilderness is coming!  Something planned.  Something intentional.�  Jacob leaned back on his arms, taking in the blank canvas of earth that he sat upon.
	Paul pushed a pile of dirt of over his last seed.  He crumpled the packet and stuffed it in his back pocket, walking away too quickly to hear what Jacob was saying.  He walked behind Rebekkah, out of her sight, dropping the spade on the table, out the front gate of the garden.  It was two forty five.

	When Paul entered his house, Peter was watching TV on the couch.
	�Oh shit, did you need a ride?  You could have called -�
	Paul said noting, walking straight towards his room.
	�Wait, do you want to - tell me anything about -�
	Paul�s door slid firmly into place, then there was the sound of the lock pivoting, and then there was silence.
	

	Paul lay in his bed with his blankets completely covering him.  There were no clocks in Paul�s room, so it�s hard to say for how long he lay there, motionless.  When he pushed them off of him the light from the window was gone and the streetlights had come on all down the street, off into the distance til they were just little floating orbs of pale yellow light.  The sight filled Paul with a sort of dim peace.  
	Now uncovered in his bed, in the all but dark bedroom, Paul began to write in his spiral notebook.  It was filled with scattered thoughts and feelings, lacked dates or time periods or cohesion of any sort.  That�s because it was not written to be read, simply to expel.  

	I think I have a garden.

	Paul twisted a pencap around in his mouth.  

	I think my garden is very empty.  Maybe I don�t water it enough, or too much.  Maybe I never planted anything.  Maybe I can�t.  Maybe I wasn�t meant to be planted on.


	Would you believe that at that very moment, Rebekkah was writing in a notebook as well?  Her�s was a full blown diary, dates and organization and all that.  She bought notebooks in packs of threes, filled them cover to cover.  Unfortunately, I can�t tell you what she's written, out of respect for her privacy.  You wouldn�t understand it anyway, her thoughts are too intimate to understand - that intimacy is where the the very concept of a diary finds its origin. 
	Alright, I will tell you a little bit.  Tonight, Rebekkah has written 

	I am not a princess

	Over and over again.
	Here�s something you might not know about girls - inside their head, there is an imago dei of everything a lady should be.  And inside that, there is a real girl - scared because she does not fill it out at all; everywhere there is leftover space, allowing sobs to return days, years later.  It is hard for them to tell sometimes if they are crying over something that happened today, or many years ago.  Emotions are cyclical like that, which is why at about the thirteenth iteration of I am not a princess Rebekkah burst into tears.  Whether it was about something that happened that day, or something that happened a long time ago, Rebekkah was unsure.

            <Title>Chapter 4 - The End</Title>
            <Text>	Peter was at the gym, lifting heaving objects repeatedly so that the strain would cause him arms to grow larger.  With a large cluster of metal moving up and down in one hand, he descreetly scanned the room for other occupants.  No one near his age, again.  He�d thought surely the Sunday after school got out, football teams and their cheerleading counterparts would be hitting the gym to kick off a summer of outdoor festivities, the likes of which Peter imagined to be shirtless hiking up mountains, games of powder puff football or keg softball, followed by elaborate picnics in a park, her head in his lap, drinking tea and listening to the birds as a cool breeze plucked at the grass.
	Peter�s eyes focused on the dried dirt outside the glass walls, his small green car sitting alone in the large, barren parking lot.  He tugged the weights harder in his hand.

	It was early when Paul awoke - unwilling to take the day at face value yet, he pandiculated, and in his soft, half-awake state, allowed his thoughts to wander down whatever pleasant avenue they could find.
	His thoughts returned, of course, to Rebekkah - the moment of her smile playing like morning light on his walls - it looped and repeated, changed angles and intensity.  With his eyes closed Paul was able to chop out the good parts, stitch them together into a longer, almost believable conversation.
	�I wasn�t expecting to see you here!�
	Cut the sunglasses.  More emphatic this time.  
	�I wasn�t expecting to see you here . . .�
	Better, much better.  Now, the rather poor stitching of her face onto Jacob�s body, and - there, an afternoon together.  It was her, not him, with the packet of carrot seeds, following him in every direction, sitting close to him at lunch, never leaving him alone.  The giggle and the wrinkled nose, pasted into ever scene, looped on repeat.  She found almost everything he said to be funny.
	Paul gathered a blanket around him and shuffled slowly into the kitchen.  The warmth of the stove woke what few parts of him were still asleep, and the the dream Paul had spent all morning on slowly began to rarrange itself back into place.
	�ATTENTION EVERYONE EVERYWHERE.  PLEASE GATHER.�
	The voice had come so loud, so unexpectadly, that it had bounced the bowl of pancake batter out of Paul�s hands - he now sat on the floor, coated in tan goop, as several car alarms yelled frantically in the distance.
	�EVERYONE.  THE RAPTURE IS NOW BEGINNING.  PLEASE GATHER.�
	Paul stood to see more clearly out the window - just a few miles away, what had to be an absolutely enormous man was sitting on top of a throne, which sat somewhere no further than three miles from Paul and Peter�s residence.  The man on the throne was dressed like some sort of king - he wore a long floral robe over what appeared to be armor, and a three-pronged crown on his head.  As he spoke he thumbed distractedly through a large pile of paperwork in his hands.
	Paul�s phone was ringing.  
	�Paul what the FUCK did you here that?!�
	�Yeah can you see it?!�
	�Yeah!  Christ he�s so loud - some guy was doing squats here, he litterally threw the weights through a mirror.�
	�Should we go?�
	�YOU SHOULD.�  The man on the throne anwered loudly, making an impatient beckoning motion in Paul�s general direction.
	�Ok just a second I�ll come pick you up;� Peter said, �Just let me grab my THIS WILL NOT TAKE LONG.  PLEASE STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING you in a few!�
	Paul waited nervously on the front porch.  He paced a little bit and then stood still; leaned up against wooden banister above the garden his mother had paid a woman to plant last month.  The looming man was clearly visible in the distance, yet starring at him only seemed to make him appear less real.  Until the man moved, which was not terribly often, he looked like a giant statue, or an action figure held just so, that with one eye shut it looks large and distant.
	Peter pulled up still dripping from a shower.  If Paul had realized he was going to do that, he would have showered too - as it was, he was so preoccupied with the giant man that he had not even changed out of the clothes that were now tie-dyed brown with hardening pancake batter.
	�You smell like pancakes.� Peter remarked as he entered the car.  
	�I thought we were in a hurry.� 
	Peter shrugged.  The block was empty except for the two boys, and it appears as though they were now some of the last few people still dragging their feet.
	�SARAH.  I CAN SEE YOU UNDER YOUR BED.  DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED, WE CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL EVERYONE IS HERE.  PAUL AND PETER - OH, YOU�RE ON YOUR WAY.�
	�We're not late, are we?�
	�Looks like a little.�
	Peter nodded solemnly at the bizzare, traffic-less street they drove down.
	�So how did it go yesterday?  You never told me.�
	�You want to talk about this now?�
	�I'm just curious.�  Peter had turned the music off from the moment he left the gym.  Nothing sounded quite right this morning.
	�It was just me and her, and a bunch of homeschooled kids.�
	�What?�
	�We were the only ones from our school.�
	�So, you were the only one she invited?�
	�Or the only one that showed up.  What does that mean?�
	�I don�t know, did she talk to you?�
	�About as much as everyone else - there was this one kid - wouldn�t fucking leave me alone.  Every time Rebekkah came over he was talking at me so she just walked around us.�
	�Ah,� Peter sighed sympathetically.  �So, what�d you end up doing?�
	�I planted the fucking seeds and then I left.�
	�Did you say goodbye or like, �thanks for inviting me�, or . . .�
	�No.�  Paul slid down in the passanger seat.  �I just left.�
	�Dude she wouldn�t have invited you if she didn�t want you there.  She came up to YOU, remember.  I get that that kid was bothering you, but you can�t be all bitter because of that.�
	�You weren�t there.�  Paul curled into the fabric seat, away from Peter, his eyes fixed out the window.  Helicopters blew across the sky in tiny blips, followed by monsterous shadows that raced across the pavement in the tangental morning light. 
	About a mile from the base of the throne, the streets became congested with empty cars; some were parked neatly against the curb, while others were parked perpandicular to the street.
	�Guess we�re walking from here,� Peter groaned, as he pulled the car up on to a decorative median.
	�What the hell! Why are you parking in the flowers?�
	Peter looked at Paul blankly.  �Everyone is just - everyone�s parking like this.�
	�You could have just stopped.  Christ dude.�
	�KAREN, TURN LEFT, YOU WILL GET HERE FASTER.  YES, THERE�S NO TRAFFIC ON DOWNING RIGHT NOW . . . IT DOESN�T MATTER IF ITS A ONEWAY, YOU�RE THE ONLY PERSON STILL DRIVING.�
	�So do you think you�re going to see her again?�
	�Who, Rebekkah?  I guess next year.�
	�Isn't there going to be, like, more gardening over the summer?  Watering and all that?�
	�She didn�t say anything about it.  She would have told me about it if she wanted me there.�
	�She might�ve if you hadn�t just walked out.�
	�Can we not talk about this anymore?�  The sound of people was growing louder, the cars packed like Tetris against eachother.  The base of the throne and the man on top were so close now that looking up at him hurt Paul�s neck.  It was almost night in his shadow, where Paul and Peter pushed their way through a row of shrubbery, into the mall parking lot where the entire town stood waiting.
	Robert had landed directly on top of the north side of the mall, crushing it completely into the ground.  
	�Ahh, that was the good side of the mall.� Peter lamented.  �RIght on top of the Orange Julius, are you kidding me . . .�
	Around the crumbled debris of what was once the food court and several upscale shopping destinations, thousands of people had gathered in a semi-circle in front of the large man.  One by one he was plucking the helicopters Paul had seen out of the sky, and setting them carefully back on the ground, after crushing their roters like the wings of a fly.
	�PLEASE STOP, THAT TICKLES IMMENSLEY.�
	The crowd was handling the situation in different ways; however, all of the ways could be grouped into three main categories - fear, panic, and suspense.  A large group stood huddled in a circle, arms over shoulders.  A man darted out of the doors of a neigboring best buy with a laptop clutched to his chest.
	�MICHAEL, PUT THAT BACK!  I SWEAR.  WE CAN�T GET ANYTHING DONE IF YOU - PUT IT . . . THANK YOU.�
	The most popular activity, by far, was from the third category.  People stood, sat, and leaned nervously on all available architecture, eyes transfixed on the solemn face in front of them.
	The scene reminded Peter of a tailgate party - one that no one seemed to be particuarl enjoying.  A tailgate party for a losing home team, mixed with the line of a DMV.  Peter, for one, was mildly excited.  This was, hands down, the most fascinating thing to have happened to him in a very long time.
	�Do you want to go closer?�
	�No, I�m fine.�  Paul would have been fine watching from home.  The man on the throne continued to call out instrustions to individuals while absently sorting through his stack of department-store sized papers, the rustling of which created winds that blew dust around the lot and shook the branches of trees.  One piece slipped from the stack, creating a giant shadow over the crowd.  The people below shrieked in horror as the sheet of looseleaf floated lazily towards them.  The man on the throne attempted to catch it, the paper bouncing off his finger tips a few times before he finally snatched it about thirty feet from the ground.
	Paul wanted to go sit in the car.  He scanned the crowd nervously, flinching away from the endless ribbon of faces.  The town milled like ants around him and he had no place to put himself that was out of the way.  He stepped nervoulsy back and forth attempting to allow everyone to move in the direction they wanted without blocking them - he wished he could shut off the matter of his body and still be there without taking up space.  And then there was a face that he recognized.  Rebekkah floated listlessy through the stream of people, and then, like at school - eye contact, and she changed course to walk towards him.
	To say that this is exactly what Paul had feared would be partially true.  The feeling contradicted sense, he knew, but in his mind the idea of seeing Rebekkah again, of talking to her, was overwhelmingly recognizable as fear.  The layer of excitement that covered it was a thin gel coating over a pill that had been in his mouth too long now to swallow.
	�Paul!  Hey!�  Rebekkah made a move with her arms like she might try to hug him - she didn�t, she was just adjusting her purse.  She struggled to re-align it on her should while holding an Orange Julius in the other hand.
	�Who is this?!�  Peter knew exactly who it was, and as the two introduced themselves, Paul attempted to construct an escape plan.
	�Paul�s told me a lot about you.�
	Oh god Peter, please, stop, Paul attempted to communicate with his eyebrows.
	�ALRIGHT EVERYONE, KAREN IS HERE, WE�RE READY TO GET STARTED�  The man on the throne cleared his throat and tapped the stack of papers on his knees.  �THANKS EVERYONE FOR COMING.  MY NAME IS ROBERT.  I�M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE END OF THE WORLD IS BEGINING TODAY.�
	In the distance Paul could hear someone shouting.
	�WHAT?  THAT . . . NO, THERE ARE . . . PESTILENCE?  NO, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL WE GET ORGANIZED.  ALL WE ARE DOING TODAY ARE NUMBERS.�
	Everyone looked generally confused.  There was more shouting.
	�JESUS?  NO, I ALREADY SAID, I�M ROBERT.  SORRY, I AM NO LONGER TAKING QUESTIONS.  LISTEN, THIS IS GOING TO TAKE FOREVER IF YOU ARE NOT QUIET.�
	The crowd finally accepted this and stood quitely as Robert sorted through his stack of papers.  
	�OK.  ALEXANDRIA ADKINS: 16.  AMANDA ADKINS: 14.  ANGEL ARCHULETTA: 432 1/3.  DONALD AV - I HEAR WHISPERING.  PLEASE BE - WHAT�S THAT?  WHAT DO THEY MEAN?�
	The people nodded thankfully at whoever had posed this question.  
	�THEY ARE YOUR ASSESMENT NUMBERS.  I TAKE YOUR PAPERWORK -� Robert held a giant piece of paper towards the crowd, like a children�s book at story time.  The paper had writing on it, but it was in some unregognizable language.  The strange text was interspersed with numbers, which had been annotated in pen with long division worked out by hand.  �- I RUN THE NUMBERS, AND GIVE YOU THE RESULT.  PLEASE REMEMBER YOUR NUMBER.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THE COMING WEEKS.�
	Frantically, the people began searching for pens, scraps of paper, anything to jot their number onto.  
	�Oh no . . . �  Rebekkah tore frantically through her purse for something to write with.  �I have . . . lotion.�
	Paul produced a pen from his pocket.  He had put it in there after writing in his notebook the past night.  
	�Yesssss ok, we can just write it on our hands I guess.� 
	Robert had started in alphabetical order, but it had become apparent that some of his papers had gotten out of order.
	�MONICA LAMBERT:  4/8THS.  . . . . NO, THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS ONE HALF.  PLEASE, EVERYONE, DO NOT REDUCE YOUR FRACTIONS.�
	�So Paul,� Rebekkah spoke nervously around the loud announcements.  �I - I didn�t see you leave yesterday.�
	�JIL TAYBOR:  -43/8.�
	�Ah, yes . . . I'm sorry, I just . . .�
	Paul�s way of interacting with people may not have always made sense to everyone, but they at least understood it enough to comply.  No one had ever needed any further exposition on why Paul left places suddenly, or never showed up to them at all. 
	�RODNEY PITTMAN:  1,500.�
	�It�s totally ok, I was just happy that you showed up.  It was good seeing someone I recognized in with all the homeschooled kids.  I was actually reall afraid it was going to be a disaster but everyone got along, and we got everything planted.�  Rebekkah stared despondantly at the giant man on the throne.  �Though now I guess I wonder if that even matters.�
	The way she stood there, still, just starring off made Paul ache to know what thoughts ran through her head.
	�PETER HOLLIS: 11�  
	Peter nodded and drew a giant 11 on his hand.
	�Why'd you draw it upside down?� Rebekkah asked.
	�It�s right side up . . .� Peter insisted, extending his closed fist towards her so that she could read it.
	�PAUL HOLLIS: 1�
	�OooOOooh, wow.� Rebekkah cheered.  �I think.  I mean, I have no idea what that even means.�
	�Yeah, no clue.� Paul said as he sketched a large 1 onto his hand.  
	�Alright, I�ll be back.� Peter announced.  A nearby Sonic drive through was playing The Beach Boys, so Peter decided it was about time for a chili cheese dog.  
	�Your brother seems nice.� Rebekkah commented.  �That was your brother, right?�
	�Yeah, no, that was him.�
	�I thought he looked familiar.  He went to our school, right?�
	�Yeah, he graduated last year.�
	�He in college?�
	�No.�
	�Working then?�
	�Not really.  Its hard to explain.�
	�SARAH BARNER:  -1117.�
	Rebekkah nodded.
	�Our parents, they travel a lot?  And they just send us money, when we need it.�
	�Oh wow, that�s pretty sweet.  But I imagine its hard when they're away, for like, days.�
	�Actually, we haven�t seen them since Peter graduated.  They came back for that.�
	�Seriously?�
	�Yeah.�
	�Like . . . almost a year?�
	�Yeah.�
	�How do you guys, like . . . if you need signatures sometimes, or . . .�
	�There�s a system.  We mail them stuff.  They mail it back.  We can take care of ourselves.�
	�That�s really intense.�
	Paul shrugged.  �I don�t know, I like it.�  
	�JEFFERY WILLIAMS: 23.5678.�
	�I actually know exactly what you mean.� Rebekkah nodded.  �I live with my dad, and - yeah, I definitely wouldn�t mind that situation.�
	�Is he here?�
	�Yeah, somewhere.  He called me.  I walked here this morning, before he was even up.�
�Wait - � Paul pointed to the drink in her hand.  �Were you -�
	�Yeah, I got really lucky.  I had seriously just bought this, and I decided to go check out the pet store?  And right then, BAM!�  Rebekkah shook her purse violently to illustrate.  �Everything was coming apart.  I ran for the emergenceny exit and, here we are.� Rebekkah smiled and did a little mock-courtsey.
	�Jesus.� Paul said, shaking his head.  �Now THAT is intense.  Actually intense.�
	�Where were you when it happened?�
	�Oh - I was making pancakes.�
	�Ok, I was going to say,� Rebekkah pointed to the splotches of brown on Paul�s shirt, �You kind of smell like an Ihop.�
	�Yes, I suppose I do.�  
	�Its ok, I like pancakes.�  
	  
	
	Peter watched Paul and Rebekkah from the line at Sonic.  Most of the people working there had been called already, and had no problem serving him now.  The boy taking his order had added �38� to the end of his nametag.
	�38?  nice.  11.�
	�Sweet.�
	�My brother Paul over there?  Number 1.�
	�Damn, I heard that one get called.  Is that good?�
	Peter shrugged.  �That girl standing next to him?  He�s trying to flirt with her.  Its so painful to watch.�
	�Yeah?  Why don�t you help him?�
	�I don�t know what to tell him.  I�m personally really good at meeting girls, it just comes naturally to me, so I don�t know how to help him.�
	�Well we're just better at that, right?�
	�What do you mean we?�
	�You�re - you�re Peter Hollis right?  We went - well, I still go to Liberty High School - and I heard,�  The scanned the back room a bit. �I mean . . . because we're gay.� 	
	�What the fuck did you just say?�  Peter gripped the counter hard, peeling up the veneer of the countertop a little.
	�I just - I thought you were out . . .�
	�I am NOT fucking gay.  �
	�It wasn�t an insult, I just thought -�
	�Well you thought wrong you fucking queer, and you tell anyone else who want to call me that to come and fucking find me, I am at the gym every morning you fucking pansy.�  Peter took the hotdog without paying for it, ate it as quickly as possible while walking away, and threw the box it came in onto the street far away from a trashcan.  
	
	�REBEKKAH ROTEM: 168.�
	Rebekkah jotted the main form of the numbers down on her hand, then proceeded to fill them in with decorative vines.  
	�Is there a chance you could drive me home?� Rebekkah asked.  �With everything going on, I don�t really want to walk back alone, you know?�
	�Yeah, I�m sure Peter will be fine with that.  I wonder where he went . . .�
	�NOT YET, PAUL, NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LEAVE UNTIL WE GET THROUGH EVERYONE.�

	The exercise took all day.  Even after the numbers had been finished several people had already managed to forget theirs - as a result, the sun was begining to wane as Robert started from the top of the list again.
	�So by this point, I can barely breathe, and I'm running like my legs are broken.  It's been over twenty minutes, the rest of the class is just sitting in the grass watching me.�
	Rebekkah was laughing hard internally, but was trying to keep a straight face for Paul�s sake.  
	�It's ok, you can laugh.�
	The two had found been given a tussle of blankets by a store owner that believed the sun would never rise again, and had wanted to at least make the people near his store comfortable as the inevitable judgement of his deeds began.  Paul and Rebekkah had balled it up against a stone embankment and now leaned comfortably with their back again it, watching the sun setting behind Robert like a living movie screen.
	�So, then I started crying.�
	�Stoooop this is so bad!�
	�So I'm taking so long to finish, the coach doesn�t realize the bell has rung - so out comes the girl�s class, to me just hobbling and crying around the track.�
	�Ok ok, you win.�
	�I bet you feel better about tripping at homecoming, right?�
	�No, that was still really bad.  You don�t know what it�s like to be a girl.�
	�I'm glad, it sounds like everything comes to a grinding halt every time you make a mistake.�
	Rebekkah sighed.  �Yeah, that�s not too far off.�
	Peter had not been spotted in quite some time.  Truth be told he had calmed down considerably and was now searching for Paul and Rebekkah, who had only moved about ten feet to the right.  When he finally saw them he was a bit put off by how little concern they seemed to exhibit regarding his roughly six hour hiatus.  
	�Well I was a little concerned about you guys.�
	�Well you could have texted me.  You were the one that went wandering off.�  Paul scooted away from Rebekkah so that Peter could sit between them.  Peter shook his head and pushed Paul back towards her, sitting on the outside of them instead.  It was a silly gesture - even before he'd shown up the two sat spaced apart like siblings.  
	
	Finally around seven o�clock the last of the numerical confusion had been cleared up, and Robert moved into his closing remarks.  
	�EVERYONE!� Robert announced anthemically, at last retiring his paperwork to a giant manilla folder and shoving it into the crevice of the throne cushion.  �DON�T FORGET YOUR NUMBERS.  I SUGGEST WRITING THEM DOWN IN MULTIPLE PLACES, IN CASE YOU FORGET, OR YOUR ONLY COPY IS DESTROYED IN A FIRE.  MAYBE FIND A REMINDER BUDDY.  I WILL BE BACK WHEN I GET EVERYTHING SORTED OUT, AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT.  PLEASE TAKE CARE UNTIL THEN.  I MEAN IT.  DON'T FORGET YOUR NUMBERS.�
	WIth that, Robert�s throned levitated off the North side of the mall and rose steadily into the sky, until eventually he dissapeared out of sight.  
	Since he'd insisted on dismissing everyone at once, traffic was a nightmare.  Peter was fine with taking Rebekkah back, but reaching his car was its own sort of surreal journey.  Everywhere people ran through the streets looking for this person or another, or simply talking to others about the numbers, in a sort of fluster like the whole world was on vacation and for this moment the delicate fabric of social conduct could be skewed to one�s liking.  Everywhere along the journey back people stood outside of homes and places of business as if the power had gone out and there was no point in returning to whatever they had been doing.  A man dressed as a waiter handed Peter a champagne flute, and smiling, began to fill it.
	�Are we celebrating?� Peter asked.
	�We're not sure.� the man replied.  Car horns blarred out in the night like trumpets announcing the arrival of some undefined understanding.
	The troupe was about to their car when Paul and Rebekkah spotted a familiar face along the side of the road.  On the patio of a small ice cream parlor Jacob sat, eating a waffle cone with no ice cream inside of it.  He wore a long sleeve blue cardigan, and the same ridiculous plastery haircut.  In front of him on the table sat a plastic back of at least twelve more cones inside.
	�Oh!  Oh!  Rebekkah, and Peter!� Jacob waved frantically to them.  
	�Ya�ll want some ice cream?� a man called from inside the shop.
	�I think we're fine!� Peter called back.
	�Have you guys checked on the carrots yet?  Are they doing ok?�
	�Its only been a day, Jacob.� Rebekkah replied.  �I don�t think they're doing anything yet.�
	�Oh.  Hey, have you guys ever had ice cream?  I don�t understand the name but they taste delicious.�  Jacob knawed frantically through the tip of a second cone.
	�Are you here with someone?  Did you walk?�
	�Oh, my family drove me,� Jacob explained, �But when we got there, you will not believe this - the whole time, all they wanted to do was pray.  Facing eachother!  Not even watching!  I honestly - I couldn�t do it.  There was so much going on, and they wanted me to close my eyes!  So, I booked it.�
	�Booked it?�
	�Make a run for it.  I've just been running around since.  Talking to people.  Looking at things.  You know I never get the chance to do this - see they've only recently given me outside priviledges since I�ve turned eighteen.�
	�Your parents?�
	�Yes.  In our family, anyone under eighteen can only go out with the family as a whole.  We usually go out on every other saturday, for a hike or something.�  Jacob started cone number three.  �But I�ll tell you, if I would have known that there was - all this out here - I would have started soooo much sooner, this whole booking it thing.�
	�Those�ll make you sick if you eat too many.� Paul warned him.
	�Really?  What are they made from?�
	�I�m pretty sure its just fried batter.�
	�Is that bad?� Jacob asked, staring blankly at the ten other cones in the bag.
	�Did you get your number?� Rebekkah asked.
	�Oh, did I.�  Jacob removed his cardigan, revealing a number written upside down from one wrist to the other, right across his chest:  90,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
	�Wow.  Is that written in - lipstick?�
	�Yes, a nice lady let me borrow it.�  Jacob began to nibble at a fourth cone, this time with what seemed like restraint following Paul�s input.
	�Well we're all on our way home Jacob, would you like a ride?�  Rebekkah offered.  �Is that ok Peter?�
	�Sure, you live far?�
	�Nope, just -� Jacob pointed off into the distance.  �That way I think.�

	Rebekkah�s stop was first - she lived in roughly the same neighborhood as Paul and Peter, though the traffic made this short trip almost an hour in length.  
	�Here is fine.� Rebekkah said, pointed to what appeared to be a random street corner.  �My dad is - really weird about people, and if he sees me pulling up in a car . . . it�s just easier for me to walk the rest of the way.  I just live up the street.�
	�Fair enough.� Peter said, pulling the car up to the sidewalk.  As Rebekkah exited the car the street lights were just beginning to come on again, and Paul wondered if his window pointed this direction, if some of the streetlights he saw from his window at night were hers.
	�Oh!  Almost forgot.  Paul, you should have my number, and visa verca.�  Rebekkah motioned for him to hand her his phone.  �We�re going to water the garden over the summer, so don�t think you�re off the hook.�  Rebekkah tapped her number into the phone, until her purse began to light up and vibrate.  �Jacob, you already have my number right?�
	�Indeed I do.�
	�Alright then.  Boys, have a nice night!�  She called as she turned to make her way down the dark street.

	Jacob�s stop took much longer.  Around 10pm he made out what he thought to be the back of his house, over the top of a tall vynl fence.
	�Are you SURE this time?� Peter asked, focusing his frustration into the limited padding on the steering wheel.  �If you knock again and its not them, we�re calling you a cab or something.  Those people, they were . . . aggressive.�
	�I told you, I knew that wasn�t the place, I just thought they might know where we were going.  Yes, I�m very sure that time.  See that rock?  The big one on the corner?  I've definitely seen it before.�
	�Before tonight?�
	�Yep.  Plenty of times.�
	Jacob had Peter slow to to front of the large fence, a tall vinyl barricade that had to be at least 10 feet tall.  
	�Thanks for everything!� Jacob said, exiting the vehicle.  �Sorry I didn't know where I live.�
	�It happens.� Peter said, his hand on the shifter.
	Jacob approached the large gate of the fence, and pressed a buzzer.
	�Who is it?  Jacob?� crackled a voice through an aging metal speaker box.  
	�It is.  I'm sorry. I became lost.�
	�You RAN AWAY.  All of a sudden you turn eighteen and you think the world is your playground!�  Muffled voices and bickering could be heard in the background.  �We�ll let him in when he understands what he did.�
	�This could take a while.� Jacob warned Peter and Paul.  �You should go.�
	�Ok.� Peter said, pushing the gas to the floor.
	�That fucking kid.� Paul said as the car accelerated into the the now black night.  �THAT was the guy I was telling you about.�
	�No, I picked up on that.  Especially after he wouldn�t stop talking about the damn carrots.  Christ.�
	
	By this time Rebekkah had been writing in her diary for almost two hours.  She had needed a head start, she had a lot to write that night.  Once again I can tell you only parts of what she wrote - it began with

	168

	Went on for several pages, and then ended with

	I am not a princess

	Over and over again.  When Paul and Peter got home, they were both understandably exhausted - still, Paul found time to write

	1

	In his notebook, afterwhich he starred at it for a long time.  There�s no telling how long, since there are no clocks in his room.  But after this relatively long time, Paul wrote

	I will never call her, and she will never call me, and I will never see her again.

	Then curled into a ball and fell asleep.

            <Text>Chapter 5 - Back to the Garden


	Jacob�s father grabbed the ceramic bowl in front of him up off the table and this time slammed it into the cabinent so forecfully that it risked breaking others by association.  Jacob stood silently and walked to another cabinent to retrieve a tupperware bowl.  He set it on his placemat and sat down at his place, at a large wooden table with his seven terrified siblings, all clutching their matching bowls closely in fear.  Dust particles fluttered around the room, stirred from the comotion, visible only in the tiny beams of warm morning light that came in through the slightly open windows of Jacob�s kitchen.  The house was never open, even on nice days like this, and the stagnant air only heightened the chocking atmosphere of the room.
	�Alright.  Maybe you haven�t lied to me, but you�ve left out a great deal of important details.�
	�Is this about the ice cream still?�  Jacob�s mother was more sympathetic, but was still baffled by her son�s sudden change in behavoir.  �We�ve only kept the things from you that might hurt you Jacob, that�s a priviledge.�
	�Our family is privaledged!� his father picked up.  �Do you think freedom is what you want?  What about safety, Jacob?  You�ve been guarded here too long to understand how dangerous the rest of the world is.  We are keeping you safe, something you wouldn�t be able to do yourself.�  Jacob opened his mouth to speak, to which his father quickly imposed, �You were lucky yesterday, that is all!�  He was a thunderous, large man, his hair greyed and worn thin.  His footsteps around the table shook the silverware off of the folded cloth napkins.  Jacob held the bowl close to him so that his father couldn�t snatch it.  
	�Listen, the things you saw - the things you say you saw - they need to be put out of your mind.�
	�You still don't believe me?!� Jacob was exasperated.  �There were plenty of girls wearing shorts!  Soft, short, fabric shorts, the likes of which I've never seen!�  He recalled them in his memory as if they were a distant dream. �Some of them said things across the buttocks.  Juicy.  Cheer.  Fabulous.�
	�Tell my Jacob, why would such a garment exist?  They were clearly underwear of some kind!  It was because of Angel Robert, no girl would have ever left the house like that on a day on which the world was not ending.�
	�The world isn�t ending!�  Jacob shouted back.  He could see only a sliver of the sky out the window, over the vinyl fence, but he concentrated on it as he spoke.  �Not that world, out there, there�s too much life in it to die, I just couldn�t believe it.� He watched as his father�s shadow danced on the stone wall of the kitchen in the hot morning light.  �Even if it were, out there I could live three more lives today.  And three more tomorrow.  I could live a thousand more times over before the world has time to end.�
	�Nothing out there is real, Jacob.�  His father lowered himself into a chair, looking for once saddened.  �Your mother and I, we�ve worked hard to give you the realest, most important parts of life and spare you from the extraneous and uneccessary.  The things out there, as beautiful as they may seem now, are not important.  They will only push you further away from what is.� The man rubbed his hands over eachother, wrinked and leathery, hardened from work. 
	�Listen Jacob, we�ve made a decision as a family.  Everyone except you, that is, as you deserted us when we needed eachother the most.  While you were away we decided, the family needs to return to my father's commonality to wait for the end times.  It will be safe there.�
	�It�s safe here!� Jacob slammed his bowl onto the table, producing an unintmidating plastic boing.  �I will not be going with you.  I will be staying here.�
	�Listen Jacob, you know the rules.  You�re eighteen now.  You have a decision to make.  We won�t stand in your way.  But tell me, if not with us, where will you go?�
	Jacob thought back on the people and places he had brushed with in the four days since he had turned eighteen.  Friday had been mostly birthday cake and fanfare.  Saturday had been gardening . . .
	�I will go back to the garden.� Jacob announced.  He stood at his place at the table, then went and returned his bowl to the kitchen cabinet.  
	�Where?� his father asked.
	�Before breakfast?� his mother wanted to know.
	Jacob was already in his room, stuffing clothing into his hiking backpack.  Had his parents known it would one day be used as an escape device they might have thought more seriously about renting the packs instead of buying them.  
	�Only one boy of our name has EVER left at eighteen, and that was to go to university, and even THAT was a waste!  He forgot his values!  He never returned to see his family!�  Jacob�s mother braced herself against the door frame.  �He�s not leaving is he?�  She watched fearfully as the boy packed - shirts, underwear, a Bible . . . a handful of legos. 
	�Edward stop him, he doesn�t know what he's doing!�
	�You're too old to be acting like this Jacob!� his father scolded.  
	Jacob was too far past the idea of stopping.  He scooped a handful of pesonal possesions into the bag and ran to his bedroom window - he flung it open dramatically and pushed through it, knocking the screen out of place.  His parents screamed frantically as he landed face first in the dirt outside, then rolled into a run.  Through the overgrown yard, towards the ten foot high vinyl fence.  Steading his shoulder towards it, he rammed the fence at full speed - the planks bowed, and as Jacob dug his heels into the dirt against them, they snapped out of place and wobbled noisely to the ground.  The fence looked like a grin missing two teeth.  Jacob dissapeared through the gap as his parents watched, helpless, from the boy's room.  


	Paul lied on the couch staring at his ceiling.  A plate beside him held the drying residue of tiny pancake fragments glued together with blots of maple syrup, becoming dry and rubbery in the heat of the day.  The fan blades made a repetitive swish across his face as he watched the shadows of the blades growing and shrinking as they orbited from one side of the room to the other.

	Their shoulders had brushed once.  Paul had scooted a bit further away out of politeness.  There were no parts Paul felt inclined to change.
	I will never see her again.
		
	Down the hall Paul could hear water running.  He sat up and resigned himself to one side of the couch as Peter made his way into the kitchen, scavanging for food.
	�Did you make extra?�
	�No, I wasn�t sure when you�d be up.�
	�Damn.  Poptarts then I guess . . . Hey so is there anything on the news about yesterday?�
	This was the first time Paul had thought to check.  As the TV screen glowed into cohesion a frantic news scene began to solidify - a picture of a US map focused into view with hundreds of tiny Robert-shaped markers scattered about it.  �What we do know,� said a man standing beside the map, �Is that every city we�ve been able to contact has confirmed that they too recieved a visit from a large man on a throne named Robert, who warned them of the Rapture and assigned them numbers.  So far that's nearing 2.2 million Roberts yesterday.�
	�Thanks Tim.�  an anchorwoman offered.  �Mark Koebrick is on location at the site of Robert�s landing yesterday; Mark, can you give us an idea of what it�s like out there?�
	�Sure Kim, as I said earlier, not a lot of new developments to report.�  Mark stood near where Paul and Rebekkah had sat the day before, cameras pointed towards the grizzly wreckage of the good side of the mall.  �We still have many religious groups holding vigil, as well as a few curious onlookers, just waiting to see if �Robert� is coming back.  Still a lot of question and mystery surrounding yesterday�s event.  Here�s what we do know:�
	An obviously pre-recorded segment began to play.
	�Numbers, numbers, numbers.� a dubbed voice announced, as video panned across footage of yesterday�s crowd.  �We�ve all got one.  But what do they mean?�
	An old couple with a microphone aimed at them appeared on screen.
	�I think it's pretty obvious,� Earl Walters explained, looking over to Margaret Walters every few words.  �Mr. Robert, as he�d like us to call him, was an Angel of Our Lord, like he said.  He came to weigh our sins, and has given us numbers based off of that.  Looks to us like the higher your number is, the better you�d been.  Father Michaels got what, a - something in the thousands!�  The two beamed proudly.  �Me an Margaret both got in the seven hundreds, she�s been a bit better than me.� Earl chuckled, rubbing an open palm on Margaret�s back.  �But we decided that isn�t too bad, what with all the fractions given out.�
	The narration began again.  �The Walter�s suspicions of a �divine rating system� is a common one, but one that seems to vary from person to person.�
	A tall, thin, ebony-skinned man appeared on screen, staring blankly in the general direction of the camera.  On his shirt written in sharpie was the number -78.3.
	�The Lord�s game is one of weight!� he shouted, as if he were addressing not only the cameraman directly, but maybe some people behind him.  �It is said in Revalation that in the end days we will be weighed and that those who are found heavy with sin will experience the second death.  But there is time to save yourself from these forthecoming firey lakes of sulfur!  If you notice, I have room to spare.  I am looking to help some with a weight of 78.3, or lower.  This is how God has planned it, for it is through each other that we are saved.�
	�Still,� continued the voiceover, �Others insist the numbers don�t mean anything.�
	A group of teenage girls stood sipping Frappacinos in a semi-circle, facing the camera.  
	�I don�t know, it doesn�t look like anything�s changed.� one girl said, squinting off into the distance.  �I forgot my number already.  It was pretty small.  Sarah�s was, Sarah what was your -�
	�58!�
	�And Ashley�s was�
	�348.9!�
	�And Laura�s was . . . . where did Laura go?�
	�-10 and 29/34ths.�
	�Wow, that is RED-iculous.�

	�Still, regardless of what people may think they mean, most people seem proud to show them off.�
	Several clips shot at different areas of the mall the previous night showed people offering their numbers to the camera, written on body parts and clothing, some forming numerical lines and inspecting the results.  The camera turned back to the newscaster standing in the now all but empty mall parking lot.  
	�So that�s the scene out here.  Erica?�
	�Thanks Mark.� said a woman back in the newsroom.  �Real interesting stuff.  A memorial service will be held this weekend to remember those that were killed in the mall collapse yesterday.  A spokesperson for the Lakeline Mall has said that they are, �deeply sorry� for the loss of life that occurred, but that the mall was simply not built to hold the weight of a giant man on a throne.  The impending lawsuits are expected to be written off as an act of god.�
	�Whataya think?� Peter asked casually.  �You want to go find that dude, have him take your point away?�
	�Yeah, what does - how does he expect to tell?  What does he think he�s going to do?�
	Peter shrugged.  �People are fucking crazy man.  Surprised nobody�s gotten killed yet.�

	Jacob stood proudly in the center of the garden; inhaled a deep, happy breath.  
	�I�m home!� he announced to the bed of dirt.  �Where can I sleep where I won�t disturb any of your growing?�
	Jacob was becoming concerened that not a single sprout had started to poke out yet, and felt a faint concern that at this rate, he might not have food for tomorrow night.  
	�Hey, how�d you get in here?�  The voice came from behind Jacob.  Turning, he saw four young boys standing at the gate of the garden.  They were younger than Jacob, maybe thirteen, on average - they each walked a bike into the garden where Jacob stood, in a sort of semi-circle around him.
	�You're not from our neighborhood.� said perhaps the oldest-looking boy - a bit chubby but with a piercing, serious glare.  �We gotta check you.�
	�Check for what?� Jacob asked.
	�Your number.  We need to know what your number is.�
	�Oh, nine times ten to the forty third power!  What�s yours?�
	�It�s what?�
	�Nine times - it�s a nine followed by forty three zeros.�
	The boys shook their heads dissaprovingly.  �No way, that�s way too high.  You can�t stay here.�
	�You're confused.� Jacob explained.  �See, I�ll be living here now.  It all happened this morning when I -�  
	�NO, you won�t.� insisted the chubby boy, letting his bike lean against the chainlink fence around the garden�s perimeter.  The three other boys followed suit, standing in what they felt were tough-looking poses behind him.  �Tell �em Jon.� a short boy called from the back.
	�See this neighborhood?� Jon pointed into the arches of great oaks that opened to the back of the school.  �Every single one of us here, every family, got a number under 20. You catch my drift, old man?�
	Jacob shook his head.
	�Of course not.  You in your fancy little rich kid clothes, prolly never notice us.  But God did.  He set this whole neighborhood apart so that people like you can�t bother us no more.  1 - 20, all whole numbers an� shit.  What�d you call �em George?�
	�Integers.�
	�Yeah, fuckin� integers.  That�s what we are.  What Robert did, he seperated us so we can have peace finally.  Fuckin first stops aren�t allowed here anymore.�
	�Fuckin first stop!� one of the boys yelled.  Jon had never made more sense to them.  
	�You know, we have to deal with ones like you every morning, all year.  Sittin in the back, throwin shit at us.  Last stops are always gettin the shit seats and the shit treatment by people like you.  That�s why you�re not passing through anymore.  You find a different school where you can be last stop, and stop trolling through here.�
	�I have nowhere to go.� Jacob explained.  He was unsure but it felt like the boys were tightening the semi-circle around him.  His feet had found their way from the lettuce to the first row of arugula.  
	�I don�t need all the zeros.� Jacob stammered.  �You can have some.  We can share them.�
	�You think that's what matters here?�  Jon was turning red and sweaty.  �Listen, I�ll tell you one more time.  Leave.  Now.�
	Jacob felt the loose soil shift beneath his feet as his heels scraped the concrete curb of the back wall.  The carrots - he was standing right on the carrots.
	�No,� Jacob said, locking eyes with Jon.  �This is my garden, and I'm staying.�


The camera was showing a different area of town now, where a man with �9,999� written in sharpie across his chest and a bat in his hand stood in front of a preschool.  Paul and Peter lay dormant on the couch, absorbed in the steady stream of new developments.
�A few updates - first, police have confirmed that the man in front of ____ day care center is demanding to see his daughter, having cited his assesment number as a point that may overturn his child custody case, previously closed in March.  
	�Only ten blocks away, a local grocer�s market has all but shut down as the owner refuses to sell to anyone with a negative number.  This denial of service has sparked outrage for many long time customers who say they have no other alternative for their daily needs.  This is just one of many instances both locally and internationally that has started the debate of whether denying services to someone because of their number is a form of descrimination.�

	Peter nonchalantly got up and walked to the front door, making sure the deadbolt was secure.  He looked out the window.  The street was it�s typical placid self - a woman walked her dog, swinging a plastic water bottle in her hand with each jogging step.  Some sprinklers spit frantically onto the lawn of the house across the street.  

	�Well, I mean, definitely.� said a young officer standing outside the supermarket.  �But he owns the market, and has the right to refuse service to pretty much anyone.  Now, if he was descriminating by race, or gender, there�s a number of laws we could enforce to ensure equal treatment.  But with nothing on the books regarding the numbers, we can�t legally interfere.  It�s wrong, definitely, but we really can't do anything besides ensure that no one's getting hurt, or anything like that.�

	Paul�s pocket began to vibrate.  Retrieving his phone he tried to mentally place the number with no name attached to it - same area code, but completely foreign in all other respects.
	�Hello?�
	�Paul?  Is this Paul?�
	�Yeah, who is -�
	�This is Rebekkah, I�m on the move.  I need you to - could you and Peter come pick me up?�
	Paul shot a paniced look to Peter who still stood at the front window, pulling a lacy curtain out of the way to watch the street.  �Who�s that?�
	�Sorry, I did NOT explain this very well,�  Rebekkah continued, the sound of panting and hurried footsteps puntuating her sentances.  �So Jacob just called me.  He's in the hospital.  Aparently I'm the only person he had to call.�
	�Is he alright?�
	�Sorta, I think - I was going to go see him, and I didn�t want to get my dad involved - but the hospital I guess is really far away.  And he was looking for you anyway.  So I guess I'm saying, what are the chances,� the audio became muffled by a dense scuffling sound, �that you, and Peter, want to come pick ME up, wherever I am, and take me to the hospital, so I can check on Jacob?�
	�Paul!�  Peter called, his eyes still transfixed out the window, �That girl Rebekkah just ran out of the bush across the street.�  Paul ran to the window, where a few yards away Rebekkah stood in the middle of the street, phone to ear, staring blankly up and down the block.

	�So he . . . hurt himself?  How?�  Peter looked at Rebekkah in the rearview mirror, anxiously tapping out a message on her phone.
	�Not a clue.  His voice was really muffled and then he had to hang up.  Now he�s just sending me these garbled texts, they�re not even words.�  Rebekkah leaned forward and showed the her phone to Paul -

	Paul shook his head, in no way looking forwart to what bizzare interaction awaited him at the hospital.  Once again he sat a few feet from Rebekkah, unshowered and unsure of what to say.  The gradual and unexpected comfort he had found with her the previous day was lost, seemingly reset to the silent default he greeted strangers with.  A few times he opened his mouth slightly, attempting to coax an intelligible string of words.  Each time, he shut it again and sunk a bit lower in his seat.
	�Do you think it has something to do with the numbers?�  Peter wondered out loud.  �People are fucking crazy today.�
	�Yeah, and actually I was going to ask about the bat.� Rebekkah pointed to the steel Loiuseville slugger Peter held between his leg and the center console of the car.
	�Jeez, you and Paul both.  He was like, begging me not to bring it.  You see the news?  Paul�s one number away from not being able to buy oranges in this neighboorhood.�  Peter scanned the streets methodically as he drove for possible sources of threat.  Nothing looked terribly out of place.  No one near his age.  He had the faint rumble of double bass and shrieking guitars playing out of the speakers just in case.  

	The nurses had not wanted the bat in the hospital, but Peter had insisted.  He tucked the handle into his belt, and explained the thing about the oragnes to her as they walked down the hall to the section Jacob had been set up in.
	�We�ve had a lot of bat-related injuries today, is all.�  The nurse commented as it swung precariously at his side with each step.  �Your friend for instance - we though it might have been something like that at first, but now they�re thinking it was just fists.  But a lot of them.�
	�He got beat up?� Rebekkah hung close to the nurse, walking at times ahead of her.  
	�Preeetty bad.  He�s ok, he just needed a whole mess of stitches.�  She led the group into a room room and motioned to what was probably Jacob, sitting upright in a bed.  His entire face, as well as his forearms, were covered in thick white bandages.  
	�Your friends are here.�  the nurse called to Jacob, who scanned the room like an animatronic bear at Showbizz Pizza.
	�Rebekkah?  Paul?�
	�And Peter, he�s here too.  Oh Jacob . . .� she whinced, getting a closer look at the cuts and bruises the prodtruded from the bandaged areas of his arms and face.  �What happened?�
	For a moment Jacob was quiet - actually quiet.  
	�Did you get in a fight?� she asked.
	�I went back to the garden.�  Jacob explained.  �But it was nothing like the first time.  None of the people there were friendly.�
	�Well it wasn�t the same people,�  Rebekkah explained, �Not everyone is going to be friendly to you, like we were.�
	�Lotta fucking nutjobs out there, especially today.� Peter said.  �What were you even doing out there?�
	Jacob shook his head defeadedly.  �I had a choice,� he explained.  �To either stay with my family and return to my uncle�s commonality or to set off on my own.�
	�So you went to the garden?�
	�I thought it would have the best accomodations.  It was that or the ice cream parlor from last night.�
	�Yeah, they're not going to let you live in either of those places.� Peter said.  �No offense man, but you don�t really seem prepared for this.�
	�I feel similarily.�  Jacob sighed.  �I thought I would not need a home, in the traditional sense.  But now I am unsure and I have left mine, and cannot return.�
	�Why not?  I remember where you live.�
	�Because the choice had already happened!�  Jacob shouted.  No expression was aparent from beneath his bandages, but the air held a palpatable tension as the group stood silently beside the shaken nurse.  �I never really had a say in it.�  Jacob said, restoring his voice.  �It wasn�t a choice at all.  The moment I stepped out of my house, into the garden - I knew a part of me could never go back inside, to the way I had be living before.  I came out here and I experienced in two days more than I had in my entire lifetime.  And just because it is harder, or more painful, does not change the fact that I can�t go back now, to pretending that I don�t know what lies outside the walls of my home.  It changed me.�  Jacob held his white-tied arms up to his face, long strands of his disheveled hair falling over the tops of the bandages.  �And though the transformation is not complete, it cannot be stopped now, what has started.  I am a different person now.�  
	He traced a finger up and down his cheek bone.  �It�s funny but, the pain - I kind of liked it.  It was my own.  Does that make sense?�
	�It does.� Paul said.
	�Paul, there you are.  I was begining to doubt your presence.  I want you to know that the radishes are fine.  And the carrots.�
	�That's good,� Paul insisted earnestly, �but you know you can�t live there.�
	Jacob nodded.  �It appears not.  I have to - � Jacob shook his head - �How do you get a house?  If I were to knock, and offer a price -�
	�I think you�re a few steps away from that one.�  Rebekkah interjected.  �You need someone you can stay with until you get your feet on the ground.�  Her sweet, deep eyes turned to Paul and Peter.  �It just so happens, Paul was telling me that since his parents are away, he has lots of space -�
	�Weellll, LOTS of space, I don�t know -� Peter began, but was stuttered to a halt when Rebekkah�s eyes turn to tangental discs.  She mouthed instructions silently, clearly - 

YOU
TAKE
HIM
IN

� . . . Sure, you can come stay for . . . a bit.�  Peter�s eyebrows negotiated with Rebekkah�s gritted teeth - �For . . . as long as you need.  But realistically, how out of reach is an apartment for you?�
	�So it�s settled.� Rebekkah clapped her hands once deftly.  �How much longer do you need to be here?�
	�He can leave now,� the nurse said, �He just needs some help until the bandages come off.  Probably a week.�
	�We�re on it.� Rebekkah said, offering a hand to Jacob, who lied motionless in the bed.
	�I am not sure I am ready.�  Jacob let his head fall backward into the pillow behind him.  �The world requires more of me than I had thought.  If I am going to live here, I am going to need to be different.  Being Jacob is not enough.�
	�I don�t think that�s true.�  Rebekkah sat down softly on the bed near Jacob�s knees.  �It took a lot of something to leave home.  To go to the garden, fight for what you wanted.  There�s strength inside of you, or none of that would have happened.�
	�If that�s true, I don�t feel it.�  Jacob said.  �Do I look like strong?  Like I have something inside of me?�
	Truth be told, Jacob didn�t look like anything.  The bandages hinted subtely at shapes, like the face of a maneqquin.
	�Ok, I've got this,�  Peter announced, �I know where we�re going next.�


	The people that stood on sidewalks and parking lots passing by Paul�s car window sorted themselves into categories.  The news programs in the morning had helped and now he saw three distint groups:

	1.  The Hunters
	These were the people Jacob had met, and who occupied the news that morning.  The numbers had made them outwardly and inwardly critical, and they sought to make sense of them forecefully and immediately.  Passing a Best Buy Paul could see a group of men carrying boxes upon boxes out while balancing make-shift weapons in a free hand - garden tools, hatchets, pocket knives - while the store attendees stood around aimlessly, helpless as their stock slowly hemorraged from the sliding double doors.

	2.  The Hiders
	Paul wanted to be in this group.  They were at home, watching the events play out on television, behind locked doors.  Maybe they were inwardly critical too, but they felt no need to show it.

	3.  The Indifferent
	This is the group Paul had been more or less thrust in to by his brother, who drove through the commercial district searching for a shop he had visited once and could not remember the exact location of.  They filled parking lots and shops, behaving normally but cautiously, attempting to shake and dismiss the events as a helpless aberation in their otherwise normal lives.  Life was normal, still, despite outward appearances - nothing had changed any more than you allowed it too.

	�Ok ok here we are.�  Peter pulled his car up beside one of several shops lining an old neighborhood road - the entrance, the entire length of the store was decorated with large skulls made of plastic, plaster, some as tall as the door.  Chicken wire wrapped over them and held articles bundles of bones, staffs, and plastic weapons, beneath a large hand-painted sign which read in old-style serif - �Flossy McGrew�s�.
	�Jacob!� Peter announced to the skeptical crowd.  �You need to become someone.  Someone different.  We're going to go in here, and turn you into a different person.  Grandma Goth is going to help.�
	The store's inside was packed, wall ceiling and floor, with costumes, jewelry, accessories; and so many other types of various things that it was hard to see them as individual items instead of a giant growth of color.  The dim, expansive interior smelt vaguely of incense and was quiet save for the distant scattered ruffling of fabric.  
	�Where�s Grandma Goth?� Peter stood at a glass counter, behind which a tall man with a beard was affixing individual price tags to a pile of scarves.
	�We don�t know.� he replied, not even looking up.  �We haven�t seen her since Robert came.�
	�Oh.� Peter looked a little saddened by the news.  �Is she ok?�
	The man shrugged.  �No one knows.�
	Rebekkah walked slowly towards to back of the shop, into a large, ballroom-like expanse filled with circular racks of clothing.  The high arched ceilings faded into complete blackness before reaching their apex, and from where she stood more and more arched entryways were visible, going back and back and back.  Paul walked a row or two behind her.  The dim lights were nice.  The construction lamps that hung from wires looked like street lights over a vacant cloth town.
	�The store didn�t look this deep from outside.�  Rebekkah wandered forward into the dark space, her eyes searching every visible inch.  She turned when she saw a giant mirror, framed by dozens of colored wigs hanging from styrafoam heads.  
	�Peeeeeeerfect . . .� she said, prancing up to inspect them.  She turned to Paul, and with her hand to her chin she studied him, his thin frame covered by more greyish clothes, though different from what he'd been wearing the day before.  Turning back she rifled through the hills of fake hair, at last retrieving a rainbow mohawk wig.
	Paul balanced the monstrosity on his head.  The strands of colors swished back and forth as Rebekkah afixed a neon blue bobcut to herself.
	�I�ve thought about dying my hair blue, you know.�  She brushed the colored locks around her shoulders, shook her head back and forth.  �Or going this short.  I think it would look cute.�
	Paul knew that Rebekkah wasn�t fishing for compliments, but that she would smile if he confirmed her suspicisions that yes, she looked adorable with a neon blue bob, that really anything on top of that face was going to look just fine so long as it didn�t cover her radiant eyes.  Paul knew this.  But he said nothing.  Why?  You tell me why.  Tell Paul why.  The fuse of his tongue longed to ignite a bundle of words in his throat, but some nameless thing kept him perpetually from striking the match.
	�I think I would feel like a whole different person, definitely.  I see where Peter is coming from.�
	Fingering through the wigs, Rebekkah paused, and pulled a sparkling tiara from the back of the wall.  Placing it delicately on her head, she stood back and stared into herself, hand on her elbow.  She gave a little laugh.  
	�This is just too silly.�  She pulled the tiara and wig from her head and placed them back on a dummy scalp.  �Where did Jacob and Peter get off to?�
	Around the corner Jacob and Peter stood before a similar mirror, this one covered in rubber masks.
	�Really Peter!� Jacob protested.  He had slid the bandages around his angry eyes to glare at Peter.  �Is that what you think of me?  A zombie?!�
	�Listen dude, we've got limited options here.  You turned down all the normal ones.  You can either pick a realistic one, or, like, a monster.�
	�THAT is not how it works at all.  There is no such thing as a realistic MASK.  They are all equally unreal.  Our goal should be to find the mask that is unrealistically as real as possible.  Does that make sense?�
	�Not even slightly.�
	�Rebekkah!� Jacob called.  �You understand what I�m saying, don�t you?  The maks must be of me, but only parts of me.  It must be equal parts something else, of the thing I am becoming.�
	�Yeah, I know what you mean.� she replied, taking a handful of masks from Peter.  �And you�re not a zombie, are you?�
	�Hardly.� he said, re-affixing the mask to a mannequinn head.  �Where is the Grandma Goth you spoke of?  Who could help me become someone else?�
	�No one knows where she is.� Peter explained.
	�Did you know her well?� Rebekkah asked.  �Are you worried?�
	�Nah, nah I mean she's a total weirdo.  I only talked to her like, once.  She�s just big on this whole, �being yourself� thing.  I thought she might be able to help.  But I guess you�ll have to decide yourself.  Jacob!  Decide!  What are you now?�
	�No pressure!� Rebekkah added reasuringly.
	Paul had begun to fidget with a large crimson curatin against the wall, attepting to remove himself from the situation until the conflict passed.  Behind it he could see more rows of what looked like they could be masks.  He grabbed the curtain from as high up as he could and attempted to move the ringlets across the pole, but it seemed to be caught on something.  Giving the whole thing perhaps too hard a yank, the curtain split and ripped vertically from top to bottom.
	�Whoa buddy, don�t go tearing shit up.  I know you�re getting atnsy.�
	�THAT.�  Jacob pointed at what the panel had revealed behind the curtain - a row of African style wooden masks.  
	�That one right there.�  
	At the top hung a tribal mask - white, with tiny horizontal slits for eyes and mouth.  The circumfrence was ringed with a heavy green stroke, with vertical streams of blue coming from the eyes and mouth.  
	�The white one?  It looks like it weighs a ton.�  Peter hoisted it down, feeling the weight of it.  Jacob fixed it firmly to his face, and surveyed the group.  
	�Can you see?  The eye holes are tiny.�
	�Not a problem.� Jacob replied.  �It�s BEAUTIFUL.  It�s composition is nothing, it is it�s substance that speaks to me!�
	�At least it�s not a bleeding head or something.�
	Jacob moved his way to the front of store, clumsily - though to be fair, he was not graceful before the mask either.  
	�How much for this one?� he asked the man with the beard, pointing to his face.  
	�Whoa, check out Lebe.�
	�Lebe?�
	�That�s what that mask is.  He�s an African earth god.�  the man smiled, happy to share what little he knew of the topic.  �He died, or appeared to die - his bones became colored stones that took the shape of a body, but all impure things had been cast out - all that was left was pure life force.  It was through him that the Dogon people got their energy, their spirit.�
	�Lebe.� Jacob said, turning to the group.  �That�s who I am now.  Who I was becoming.�
	Paul, Rebekkah and Peter looked back, and gave a nod of approval.  
	�Lebe it is.� Peter said.  
	Lebe pulled a handful of coins and legos from his pocket.
	�That one isn't marked, is it?  Where�d you even find that?�  the man inspected the rim of the mask, finding no tag, no sign that it had ever meant to be purchased.
	�Tell you what.  It�s a lot better than those bandages.  Why don�t you just take it?�
	�Really?!�  Lebe shoved the coins back into his pocket and extended his hand.  �I don�t have much, and I don�t know how.  But I will make this up to you in some way.�
	�Don�t worry about it.  Enjoy the mask, Lebe.�
	As the quartet left the shop Lebe could feel a warm breeze funneling throught the slits in the mask, washing his face with early summer air.  He imagined the colored stones beneath his skin, where his bones used to be.  Just lying deep in there, radiating life.  
	
	�Near my house is fine again.�  Rebekkah insisted.  They had pulled up to the same anonymous curb, where the streetlights still defied Paul�s attempt to place them geographically.
	�Now, Lebe, you take care of yourself.� she said into the open window.  �Don�t get on Paul and Peter's nerves.  Call me if you need anything.�  She moved to the front row of windows.  �Peter, thanks for everything today.  You know - you�re really helping him.  You know I'd take him in if my dad didn�t-�
	�I know I know, it makes sense.� Peter surrendered.  �But we�re calling you if he get�s out of control.�
	�I�ll be there.� she insisted thankfully.  �And Paul - don�t be afraid to call me.  I called you once.  Tag.� She pushed Paul�s shoulder playfully.  Paul smiled as severely as he could, perhaps too much, and said �OK!� a little too loud.
	As Rebekkah sashayed away, Peter pushed Paul on the opposite shoulder.  �You could have showered today.�
	�We were in a hurry or I would of.�
	�Maybe you should shower when you get up in case you go somewhere instead of assuming you�re not.�
	�I have to be up and dressed by six every morning.�  Lebe interjected.  �What time do you get up?  Is there a preffered attire for breakfast?�
	�No . . no not all.�
	�What time do you leave the house?�
	�For where?�
	Lebe stared blankly at Peter in the rearview mirror.
	�We don't do anything.  Especially Paul.�
	�You came to the hospital.� Lebe said, turning to Paul.  �And the garden.�
	�Yeah, so you won�t see him again for - how long?  What would you say Paul, two weeks?  Three?�
	�Shut up.�
	�C�mon, give us a ballpark.  You gonna eat tonight?�
	Paul opened the car door as they slowed to pull into the driveway.
	�Dammit- don�t do that, it�s dangerous -�
	Pauled climbed the steps of the porch, turned his key in the door and shut it behind him.
	Lebe followed in as soon as the car as stoped, and saw no sign of Paul inside - just a dark living room hiding a dirty couch and coffee table, venetian blinds whose cords still swung slowly from being shut quickly.
	�He�s in his room.�  Peter said, fixing the deabolt and chain behind him.  �You hungry?�
	�Yeah, a little,� Lebe said, wandering inward as his eyes began to adjust.  �Will . . . will Paul not be joining us then?�
	�Nope.� Peter said, sitting down on the worn couch and flicking the TV on.  �I can tell now, when I'm not going to see him for a while.�
	�He does this a lot?�
	�Usually.�
	�Is he sick?�
	�Sort of.�
	Peter heated half a pizza that he found in the fridge, set it down in front of Lebe.  The news was completely new again - different people, different numbers.  Some things were on fire.  Some people were on stretchers.  
	�Are you worried?�  Lebe watched the TV carefully, his head bobbing from ticker-tape to story.
	�Not really.�
	�Do most things not bother you?�
	Peter shrugged, looking down the the hallway towards Paul�s room.
	�I don�t know.  You can be bothered by stuff, but you don't have to worry about it.  Those are two different things.�
	Lebe nodded.  �I�m bothered by being homeless.  But I'm not worried.�
	�Good.  You know, you�re not homeless.  You're staying here.  Sleeping in the garden, that�s homeless.�
	Lebe shook his head.  �I don�t know if that�s homeless.  ness.  There's a gazebo.�
	�I don�t think that�s a home.�
	�If you and Paul and I lived in the gazebo, would it be a home then?�
	Peter chuckled.  �This isn�t my best subject.  As long as you�re safe someplace, I�d call that home.  You�re not safe in the garden, you saw that.  You are safe here.  That's the difference.�
	Lebe took this as a sufficient answer.  He pushed his head back into the cushion of the couch.  
	�Can I sleep here?�
	�That works.  You want some blankets or something?�
	�It�s warm enough.�
	�You gonna sleep in the mask?�
	�Yes.�
	Peter moved into the hallway, listened for a moment - no sound from Paul�s bedroom, no sound from the couch.  He checked the doors to make sure they were still locked.  He grabbed the bat and made his way to his room, and soon he was all quiet as well.

            <Text>Chapter 6 - Wise &amp; Foolish Builders

Lebe sat up on the couch in a start, swatting at something he could not quite picture in the fogginess of his mind.  The room had the unique feeling of being recently occupied, though whatever had been sharing the space with him in the minutes prior was gone now.
	It was morning, that much could be inferred through the light filtering in through the closed blinds and the shrill and frantic call of Acridid grasshoppers outside.  They�re known for their short antenneae and sloping forheads, and above all, their long song of courtship.  The music the males play with their spiny legs takes their female of choice through three acts - at first, the female ignores the males.  This is normal.  Then comes the second act, the passive acceptance of the male, a consolation no doubt to the self-conscious suitor but still, he keeps playing.  Finally, the third act.  Active attraction.  She sings.  At this point, females will permit copulation following brief courtship, though sometimes without it.  The latter of these grasshoppers are referred to as whores.
	One such grasshopper sat on a flower stem a few feet from the house, it�s mate playing the song Lebe had heard many times outside of his own bedroom; yet he knew this to be the only thing the two places had in common.  The sound brought him no comfort as his eyes adjusted to the dark interior of the Hollis� living room - large, vacant, being misused as a bedroom.  
	Lebe pushed his mask back into place, which had become twisted in his sleep, and began to inspect the place. He could not feel a single person awake in the entire house, though it was nearly a quarter past six.  The carpet, which his own home had lacked, had a spongy consistency that masked his movement; still he treaded softly like a guest in a museum.
	His feet turned to sharp, sticky taps as they hit the linoleum.  It was crowded with stacks of mail and used food containers, piled upon tables and in corners, and everywhere there was the smell of the vague unsanitary.  
	Beneath one such stack of homogenous trash sat a long, rectangle wooden table, with a chair on each side.  Lebe attempted to clear himself a spot at the end by stacking several empty pizza boxes and plastic cups and moving them to the one free spot in the kitchen, the stove top.  However, when he got there the stove still radiated a slight heat, so he was forced to set the stack on the floor.  Not that this was in any way a novel concept, several more just like it lined the wall of the trash can.
	Lebe sat down at his spot, and momentarily conisdered the blank clearing of wooden tabletop before him.  He stared into the kitchen, at the cabinets and refrigerator door, before standing again and walking back to the couch.  
	Lebe retrieved his Bible from his backpack - it was a soft, worn leather edition, New American Standard Bible.  Lebe preferred the glossier language of the NIV or even, his parents fobid, King Jame�s Version - but being the oldest in his family his copy was passed down from his father, so he was more or less stuck.  Jacob had made a small compromise with his parents, that if he were to study from the sitfly worded family Bible, he�d be allowed to pick out a more visually appealing cover for it.  The cover Jacob had choosen was something like what an explorer would wrap a book in - thick canvas, lots of cargo pockets on the front holding a variety of notes and trinkets he�d collected.
	At the time his family had been finishing a three week study of Jude, and was getting dangerously close to Revelation, Lebe�s least favorite subject of the year.  Not that Lebe was particuarly fond of Jude either.  Realizing suddenly that he was no longer obligated to pick up where his family had left off, he flipped through the frail, thin paging looking for a new place to pick up.
	Why not indulge?  Lebe turned to Matthew 9:16, the first of his favorite part of the Bible - the 46 parables of Jesus.  Often less than a paragraph long, Lebe always found them to be the most galvanizing and true.  Sure, there was plenty of straight talk in the Gospels, Proverbs - but he always understood things more clearly when they were told to him in the form of a story.  Jesus understood that, which is why he told so many of them, when people were looking for a straight answer.  Jesus wasn�t much of a straight-answer kinda guy.  Neither was Lebe.  

�But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.�

Doesn�t really seem like a begining, does it?    It�s followed immediately by parable number two:

�Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.�

Lebe stood and opened a row of vertical blinds that covered a sliding glass door that lead to the Hollis� back yard.  The light was nice, warm.  Lebe thought to himself of the new things that awaited him outside.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>	Paul’s room has one window - it had been augmented with a towel and a down comforter to block out as much light as possible, but what did filter in was recognizable as the light-blue hue of early dawn.
	Id pattered his way around the bed, mewing quietly and pressing his face into Paul’s ear to purr loudly.  The cat's cold nosed forced him into consciousness, a sharp contrast to the warm morning that felt somehow indimidating.  In the sleepfulness of the morning he had forgotten the promises he had made the night before, and now as they came trickling back he felt his stomach sink and a hot buzz begining in his head, an uncomfortable-ness that plauged his entire body with a manic itch caused him to sit up and catch his breath.
	Seven hours, he told himself.  By three o’clock you’ll be home.  
	Paul threw the corner of the comforter and towel over the curtain rack, allowing just a slice of light to illuminate his open closet.  Everything he owned was plain and functional - sweats, tshirts, dilapadated jeans; nothing really suited for gardening.  Still he dug through the piles that had collected beneath the empty hangers, hoping that some abberation waited for him at the bottom.
	He stood back, and looked himself in the mirror.  He wondered if Peter would have the same messy, loose curls that he did if he let his hair grow out.  Paul wasn’t a huge fan of the military-esque buzz that Peter kept, but he could see why he did it - several months without maintenance left his hair piled haphazaardly upon his head, falling leftward and into his face just a bit.  The plain grey shirt he had picked out had a giant diagonal crease down the front from sitting beneath the pile of clothes in his closet, but this was ok.  Paul looked himself in the eye and repeated:
	You will never see these people again after today.

	Paul had not known Rebekkah before two days ago - he had passed her in the hallways at school, sure, still he knew her only as a component of a whole, the way he knew the few hundred others that he shared classrooms with.  She was damn pretty.  In a natural way - her straight brown hair looked good when she did nothing to it, her eyes were alluring because they were always glossed in wonder and sanguity.  It was not the proper application of makeup but that glow that made her look completed; even in baggy sweats, even on off days.  Paul had noticed all this, from afar, but this was nothing new.  There were pretty girls everywhere, girls that were pretty for a variety of reasons.  The part that moved Paul, as he had explained it to Peter, had nothing to do with appearance.
	“No one, ever?” Peter had asked.
	“Well, no.” he’d replied, “But that doesn’t really bother me.  I like being left alone.”
	“So when she came up to you - that was the first time someone tried to talk to you, since . . .?”
	“Since I can remember, I guess.  Everyone knows I don’t talk to people.”
	“Does Rebekkah know that?”
	“She’d had to’ve.”
	“Then why did she come talk to you?”
	“I don’t know why.”

	Paul stood at the stove in the dark kitchen, heating a skillet.  As he stirred the bowl of pancake batter he replayed the conversation he and Rebekkah had shared, pulling up the corners of it, looking for hidden meaning.  
	There had been a few dozen people in the hallway at the time - socializing, rummaging through lockers . . . but she had come directly to him.  
	She had seemed - not desperate.  Genuine, maybe.
	“Hey, how’s it going?” she had said, a friendly bounce in her voice.
	“Gooood.” Paul had replied, confused.  The greeting was just familiar enough to make him question whether he had been mistaken for someone else.  
	“Sorry, I don’t think we really know eachother - I’m Rebekkah!  Didn’t we have, like, Spanish together or something?”
	“Ah, I don’t know, maybe.”  They definitely had.  He had spent a considerable ammount of time pretending not to be starring at her and her friends - a grouping of four or five similarly attractive girls in the back corner of the classroom.  He was pretty sure they had caught on eventually, had started facing away from him intentionally to show that his surveilance was not appreciated.  If he’d ever said anything, to any of them, maybe the admiration would have come off a little more endearing, or maybe he would feel less inclined to stare, having finally made verbal contact with them but - that had been the year before, and he was glad that, at least superficially, any previous encounters had been scrubbed from the record.  
	“Well, we’re planting a garden in the lot behind the cafeteria over the summer.  Anything we grow is going to be donated to the food pantry downtown.  A-S-S-U-M-I-N-G we actually grow anything, which is hard to say at this point, have you seen the back patio?  I know they’re still in the middle of clearing it but its really hard to imagine anything growing there right now!”
	“Yeah,” Paul bobbed his head along to the syncopation of the conversation.  He was so focused on remaining an active participant that he found it hard to hear what she was saying.  
	“Aaaaanyway,” she continued, swaying slowly from foot to foot, “Eight to three, lunch provided.  Though, you could totally bring a snack or something, I think we're just bringing PB&amp;Js, and those little bags of chips?  Probably koolaid or something, I'm not sure.  Sooo yeah, maybe I’ll see ya there?”
	“Yeah, maybe!”  Paul funneled the anxiety into a sort of feigned excitement - happy, but noncommital.  
	“Ok great!”  And with this she smiled, pivoted, and walked away as casually as she had approached.

	Peter burst through his bedroom door.
	“We're not running late, are we?!”  He knew they were running late.  Paul placed his dishes into the dishwasher as Peter scoured the counter frantically for his keys.
	“I am not going to fuck this up for you.”
	“There’s nothing to fuck up.”
	“Well I don't want them to wait for you.”
	“They're not going to, no one even knows if I'm going.”
	“Rebekkah-” Peter began to say, then stopped himself.  “No pressure, I'm just saying, let’s show this girl you can show up places on time.”
	As Peter started his car, hardcore began to crackle angrily out of the cold speakers.  Paul entered the car head last, motioning for Peter to turn it down before he was all the way inside.
	“How do you listen to that shitty metal all the time?  Isn’t it giving you brain damage?”
	“Hell no.  This is the only kind of music I like.  Just so - raw, do you not feel it?  Great lifting music.”
	“You are such a douche sometimes.”
	“What? Just cause I like metal and got some meat on my bones?  You can say what you want, the ladies dig guys that are in shape like this.”
	“I haven’t seen you with a girl since high school.”  A sudden pang of fear hit Paul.  “Why am I even taking advice from you?”
	“Would you RELAX?”  Peter turned the volume knob down until it clicked off.  “The only advice you’re taking from me so far, is seeing this girl again.  That’s it.  Anyone would tell you that much.  The rest, just figure it out as you go.”
	Paul could not decide if this was better or worse advice.
	“You know, its really - just, its good to see you.  Like, up and dressed, going out.  This has been a good week for that.  I really just -”
	“Shut up.”  
	Paul was serious.  Peter knew not to push it.  

	The garden Rebekkah had spoken about was at the center of a large courtyard that hung off the back of their school.  It opened up to a neighborhood on the south side, and had never been very well kept.  Now the overgrown patches of dirt were raked clean, and a dozen or so volunteers milled around the area on their hands and knees.  
	Pauld didn’t recognized a single one of them.  Not even as component of a whole.  These were completely new faces, not a single one of which had he ever seen at his school.
	Except for Rebekkah - she stood by an out-of-place rusty fold out table, presumably errected for the event.  On it sat a few dozen seed packets, some gardening tools, and a  few pairs of brand new, flimsy-looking gloves.  She was holding a bag of seeds up to a boy, motioning to the neat rows of dirt.
	“Yeah, about six inches apart - but you want to keep them straight, k?  See how we dug the row?”
	“Definitely, definitely - just - they could go anywhere, correct?”
	“What do you mean?”
	The boy surveyed the garden like long division, a subtle sort of excitement creeping up into him.  “If I plant them outside the rows, they'd still turn into plants, right?”
	He was hardly dressed for gardening - he wore a blue collared shirt, buttoned to the very top, and stiff navy blue pleated shorts.  His hair was plastered into a semi-solid state of neutrality, the kind of haircut seen on polititicians over fifty.  He rummaged through the seed packet with one hand.
	“One seed is - one plant, right?”
	“Y-yeah, I think that’s generally how it works.”
	Rebekkah caught the image of Paul out of the corner of her eye, and began to wave excitedly.
	“Paul!  Wow!  I wasn’t expecting to see you here!” she jangled up beside him, a packet of seeds and a pair of gloves in her hands.
	“Oh look at you!  Gloves and everything!  You got some seeds in those pockets too?”
	“Ohh, no, I didn’t - ”
	“Oh no I’m kidding that would be . . . ”
	Paul already felt ridiculous.  Every set of words that tumbled out of his mouth stung his lips painfully.  
	“Well luckily I have plenty of those.”  Rebekkah pulled a packet of carrot seeds from her back pocket.  They were warm with body heat in Paul's hand; the tiny envelope had sealed itself shut from the hummitidy of the day.  
	“Radishes!  Back wall - keep ‘em straight.  You see where we dug the rows?  Just start over by Jacob over there.” she pointed to the neat looking boy that’d been contimplating seeds a moment before.  “Oh shoot, I should have introduced you while you were both here.  You probably don't recognize anyone, huh?
	“Ah, no.”  Was that really a point of concern?
	“Yeah, these guys are from Calvary.  Homeschooled kids.  They do this thing,” she explained, “Where they make them all get together and interact with each other?  Like, they have group P.E. classes where they all play dodgeball.”
	Paul examined the kids in the garden, and it made sense - they seemed to vary in age slightly, and all had this sort of frightened look to them.  He imagined what sort of pathetic game of dodgeball was played between these people.  They averted their eyes when he looked at them.  It was a huge relief.
	“Alright well,” Rebekkah continued, “You get goin’, I’ll be comin’ around with lots of water.  Drink lots of water!  If you pass out we’re leaving you there and using you as fertilizer.”
	“Ok.”  Paul began to walk to the back wall of the garden.
	“Paul!” Rebekkah called.  “That’s not true.  I shouldn’t say stuff like that.”
	Paul nodded.

	Well that went well.  Paul dug his spade into the hot, dry dirt that bit at his bare knees.  A girl a few rows down had giant kneepads.  Why hadn’t Peter thought of that?  He could already feel a sunburn starting on his neck.  If it was possible to garden bitterly, Paul was pulling it off quite well.  Rebekkah stood at the other side of the garden by the rusted table.  Paul felt silly for coming.  He had no actual desire to plant radishes.

	“You have to move faster if you want them all to sprout at the same time!”  
	The boy in the pleated shorts - Jacob - had planted his way up to the side of Paul.  Somewhere a few yards back his row had bent and b-lined to him, creating a giant arc through what was supposed to be rows of cabbage and arugula.  
	“You have to get them in there all about the same time, to make sure they all pop up at the same time; otherwise the watering’ll get off.”
	“I don’t think that’s how it works.” Paul replied, turning his shoulder against Jacob and attempting to plant faster.  Jacob picked up the pace as well, passing him until they both aimed their spade at the same patch of dirt.
	“Whattaya say?” Jacob propositioned.  “We both throw our seeds in, and see what they turn into?”
	Paul began digging backwards.  
	“Reverse!” Jacob called, digging adjacent holes along side him.
	At lunch, Jacob sat as close to Paul as was possible on a cement ledge beside the table.  
	“I’ll be honest, this is my first time gardening.” Jacob explained.  
	Rebekkah walked around handing out sandwiches, using the period of exhange to check in with the gardeners about their day.  “Things going well?” Paul could hear her ask.  “Need anything?”, and things also like “Yeah, I didn’t have anything better to do this weekend” and “That’s interesting, tell me about it.”
	Paul began concocting a mental list of possible conversation - then arranged them in order of relevancy and interest.  
	“Remember that time that I pointed to the bird on the fence?”  Jacob reminisced.
	“ . . . Yes” Paul replied, his eyes still transfixed upon Rebekkah as she moved towards them with sandwiches.
	“I have a confession.  When you turned your head, I threw a carrot seed in with your radish seed.  Don’t worry, I remember exactly where.”
	Rebekkah handed a sandwich to Paul.
	“ . . -”
	“We shall see Paul!  I still think there is hope for a Raddarrot of some kind; a hybrid, if you will.”
	Rebekkah smiled, and wrinkled her nose at what she percieved as two new friends sharing a moment over a PB&amp;J.  Quietly she slinked away as not to disturb the deep, meaningful conversation the two were having.  Paul briefly considered strangling Jacob, but as he was not prone to outward expression he simply sat there, listening to him ramble on and on in between the loudest chewing he could achieve.  
	The afternoon was hotter than the morning, and the strength the food gave Paul wore off quickly.  Jacob continued his one sided banter about gardening, nature, birds, and everything else that seemed to pass his eye line.
	“Ok so get this,” Jacob pushed some long strands of hair out of his eyes, that had come unglued from the rest of his head from sweat.  “So normally, plants and things, they grow everywhere.”
	Jacob offered some time for this to sink in, while Paul attempted to finish off the packet of seeds.  Eleven left.  Almost three o’clock.  Two thirty is close enough, right?
	“In a garden though, you pick and choose what you want to grow in it.  You don’t just let things grow, you make things grow, because you prefer them.  You see what I mean?”  Jacob pointed his spade at the four corners of the garden.  “You block it off, you put what you want in there.  And for a while its empty.  I bet people drive by this garden and think ‘Oh, what a waste of space.  No nature, no nothing.’  But they don’t know, something better than wilderness is coming!  Something planned.  Something intentional.”  Jacob leaned back on his arms, taking in the blank canvas of earth that he sat upon.
	Paul pushed a pile of dirt of over his last seed.  He crumpled the packet and stuffed it in his back pocket, walking away too quickly to hear what Jacob was saying.  He walked behind Rebekkah, out of her sight, dropping the spade on the table, out the front gate of the garden.  It was two forty five.

	When Paul entered his house, Peter was watching TV on the couch.
	“Oh shit, did you need a ride?  You could have called -”
	Paul said noting, walking straight towards his room.
	“Wait, do you want to - tell me anything about -”
	Paul’s door slid firmly into place, then there was the sound of the lock pivoting, and then there was silence.
	

	Paul lay in his bed with his blankets completely covering him.  There were no clocks in Paul’s room, so it’s hard to say for how long he lay there, motionless.  When he pushed them off of him the light from the window was gone and the streetlights had come on all down the street, off into the distance til they were just little floating orbs of pale yellow light.  The sight filled Paul with a sort of dim peace.  
	Now uncovered in his bed, in the all but dark bedroom, Paul began to write in his spiral notebook.  It was filled with scattered thoughts and feelings, lacked dates or time periods or cohesion of any sort.  That’s because it was not written to be read, simply to expel.  

	I think I have a garden.

	Paul twisted a pencap around in his mouth.  

	I think my garden is very empty.  Maybe I don’t water it enough, or too much.  Maybe I never planted anything.  Maybe I can’t.  Maybe I wasn’t meant to be planted on.


	Would you believe that at that very moment, Rebekkah was writing in a notebook as well?  Her’s was a full blown diary, dates and organization and all that.  She bought notebooks in packs of threes, filled them cover to cover.  Unfortunately, I can’t tell you what she's written, out of respect for her privacy.  You wouldn’t understand it anyway, her thoughts are too intimate to understand - that intimacy is where the the very concept of a diary finds its origin. 
	Alright, I will tell you a little bit.  Tonight, Rebekkah has written 

	I am not a princess

	Over and over again.
	Here’s something you might not know about girls - inside their head, there is an imago dei of everything a lady should be.  And inside that, there is a real girl - scared because she does not fill it out at all; everywhere there is leftover space, allowing sobs to return days, years later.  It is hard for them to tell sometimes if they are crying over something that happened today, or many years ago.  Emotions are cyclical like that, which is why at about the thirteenth iteration of I am not a princess Rebekkah burst into tears.  Whether it was about something that happened that day, or something that happened a long time ago, Rebekkah was unsure.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>	Peter was at the gym, lifting heaving objects repeatedly so that the strain would cause him arms to grow larger.  With a large cluster of metal moving up and down in one hand, he descreetly scanned the room for other occupants.  No one near his age, again.  He’d thought surely the Sunday after school got out, football teams and their cheerleading counterparts would be hitting the gym to kick off a summer of outdoor festivities, the likes of which Peter imagined to be shirtless hiking up mountains, games of powder puff football or keg softball, followed by elaborate picnics in a park, her head in his lap, drinking tea and listening to the birds as a cool breeze plucked at the grass.
	Peter’s eyes focused on the dried dirt outside the glass walls, his small green car sitting alone in the large, barren parking lot.  He tugged the weights harder in his hand.

	It was early when Paul awoke - unwilling to take the day at face value yet, he pandiculated, and in his soft, half-awake state, allowed his thoughts to wander down whatever pleasant avenue they could find.
	His thoughts returned, of course, to Rebekkah - the moment of her smile playing like morning light on his walls - it looped and repeated, changed angles and intensity.  With his eyes closed Paul was able to chop out the good parts, stitch them together into a longer, almost believable conversation.
	“I wasn’t expecting to see you here!”
	Cut the sunglasses.  More emphatic this time.  
	“I wasn’t expecting to see you here . . .”
	Better, much better.  Now, the rather poor stitching of her face onto Jacob’s body, and - there, an afternoon together.  It was her, not him, with the packet of carrot seeds, following him in every direction, sitting close to him at lunch, never leaving him alone.  The giggle and the wrinkled nose, pasted into ever scene, looped on repeat.  She found almost everything he said to be funny.
	Paul gathered a blanket around him and shuffled slowly into the kitchen.  The warmth of the stove woke what few parts of him were still asleep, and the the dream Paul had spent all morning on slowly began to rarrange itself back into place.
	“ATTENTION EVERYONE EVERYWHERE.  PLEASE GATHER.”
	The voice had come so loud, so unexpectadly, that it had bounced the bowl of pancake batter out of Paul’s hands - he now sat on the floor, coated in tan goop, as several car alarms yelled frantically in the distance.
	“EVERYONE.  THE RAPTURE IS NOW BEGINNING.  PLEASE GATHER.”
	Paul stood to see more clearly out the window - just a few miles away, what had to be an absolutely enormous man was sitting on top of a throne, which sat somewhere no further than three miles from Paul and Peter’s residence.  The man on the throne was dressed like some sort of king - he wore a long floral robe over what appeared to be armor, and a three-pronged crown on his head.  As he spoke he thumbed distractedly through a large pile of paperwork in his hands.
	Paul’s phone was ringing.  
	“Paul what the FUCK did you here that?!”
	“Yeah can you see it?!”
	“Yeah!  Christ he’s so loud - some guy was doing squats here, he litterally threw the weights through a mirror.”
	“Should we go?”
	“YOU SHOULD.”  The man on the throne anwered loudly, making an impatient beckoning motion in Paul’s general direction.
	“Ok just a second I’ll come pick you up;” Peter said, “Just let me grab my THIS WILL NOT TAKE LONG.  PLEASE STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING you in a few!”
	Paul waited nervously on the front porch.  He paced a little bit and then stood still; leaned up against wooden banister above the garden his mother had paid a woman to plant last month.  The looming man was clearly visible in the distance, yet starring at him only seemed to make him appear less real.  Until the man moved, which was not terribly often, he looked like a giant statue, or an action figure held just so, that with one eye shut it looks large and distant.
	Peter pulled up still dripping from a shower.  If Paul had realized he was going to do that, he would have showered too - as it was, he was so preoccupied with the giant man that he had not even changed out of the clothes that were now tie-dyed brown with hardening pancake batter.
	“You smell like pancakes.” Peter remarked as he entered the car.  
	“I thought we were in a hurry.” 
	Peter shrugged.  The block was empty except for the two boys, and it appears as though they were now some of the last few people still dragging their feet.
	“SARAH.  I CAN SEE YOU UNDER YOUR BED.  DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED, WE CANNOT BEGIN UNTIL EVERYONE IS HERE.  PAUL AND PETER - OH, YOU’RE ON YOUR WAY.”
	“We're not late, are we?”
	“Looks like a little.”
	Peter nodded solemnly at the bizzare, traffic-less street they drove down.
	“So how did it go yesterday?  You never told me.”
	“You want to talk about this now?”
	“I'm just curious.”  Peter had turned the music off from the moment he left the gym.  Nothing sounded quite right this morning.
	“It was just me and her, and a bunch of homeschooled kids.”
	“What?”
	“We were the only ones from our school.”
	“So, you were the only one she invited?”
	“Or the only one that showed up.  What does that mean?”
	“I don’t know, did she talk to you?”
	“About as much as everyone else - there was this one kid - wouldn’t fucking leave me alone.  Every time Rebekkah came over he was talking at me so she just walked around us.”
	“Ah,” Peter sighed sympathetically.  “So, what’d you end up doing?”
	“I planted the fucking seeds and then I left.”
	“Did you say goodbye or like, ‘thanks for inviting me’, or . . .”
	“No.”  Paul slid down in the passanger seat.  “I just left.”
	“Dude she wouldn’t have invited you if she didn’t want you there.  She came up to YOU, remember.  I get that that kid was bothering you, but you can’t be all bitter because of that.”
	“You weren’t there.”  Paul curled into the fabric seat, away from Peter, his eyes fixed out the window.  Helicopters blew across the sky in tiny blips, followed by monsterous shadows that raced across the pavement in the tangental morning light. 
	About a mile from the base of the throne, the streets became congested with empty cars; some were parked neatly against the curb, while others were parked perpandicular to the street.
	“Guess we’re walking from here,” Peter groaned, as he pulled the car up on to a decorative median.
	“What the hell! Why are you parking in the flowers?”
	Peter looked at Paul blankly.  “Everyone is just - everyone’s parking like this.”
	“You could have just stopped.  Christ dude.”
	“KAREN, TURN LEFT, YOU WILL GET HERE FASTER.  YES, THERE’S NO TRAFFIC ON DOWNING RIGHT NOW . . . IT DOESN’T MATTER IF ITS A ONEWAY, YOU’RE THE ONLY PERSON STILL DRIVING.”
	“So do you think you’re going to see her again?”
	“Who, Rebekkah?  I guess next year.”
	“Isn't there going to be, like, more gardening over the summer?  Watering and all that?”
	“She didn’t say anything about it.  She would have told me about it if she wanted me there.”
	“She might’ve if you hadn’t just walked out.”
	“Can we not talk about this anymore?”  The sound of people was growing louder, the cars packed like Tetris against eachother.  The base of the throne and the man on top were so close now that looking up at him hurt Paul’s neck.  It was almost night in his shadow, where Paul and Peter pushed their way through a row of shrubbery, into the mall parking lot where the entire town stood waiting.
	Robert had landed directly on top of the north side of the mall, crushing it completely into the ground.  
	“Ahh, that was the good side of the mall.” Peter lamented.  “RIght on top of the Orange Julius, are you kidding me . . .”
	Around the crumbled debris of what was once the food court and several upscale shopping destinations, thousands of people had gathered in a semi-circle in front of the large man.  One by one he was plucking the helicopters Paul had seen out of the sky, and setting them carefully back on the ground, after crushing their roters like the wings of a fly.
	“PLEASE STOP, THAT TICKLES IMMENSLEY.”
	The crowd was handling the situation in different ways; however, all of the ways could be grouped into three main categories - fear, panic, and suspense.  A large group stood huddled in a circle, arms over shoulders.  A man darted out of the doors of a neigboring best buy with a laptop clutched to his chest.
	“MICHAEL, PUT THAT BACK!  I SWEAR.  WE CAN’T GET ANYTHING DONE IF YOU - PUT IT . . . THANK YOU.”
	The most popular activity, by far, was from the third category.  People stood, sat, and leaned nervously on all available architecture, eyes transfixed on the solemn face in front of them.
	The scene reminded Peter of a tailgate party - one that no one seemed to be particuarl enjoying.  A tailgate party for a losing home team, mixed with the line of a DMV.  Peter, for one, was mildly excited.  This was, hands down, the most fascinating thing to have happened to him in a very long time.
	“Do you want to go closer?”
	“No, I’m fine.”  Paul would have been fine watching from home.  The man on the throne continued to call out instrustions to individuals while absently sorting through his stack of department-store sized papers, the rustling of which created winds that blew dust around the lot and shook the branches of trees.  One piece slipped from the stack, creating a giant shadow over the crowd.  The people below shrieked in horror as the sheet of looseleaf floated lazily towards them.  The man on the throne attempted to catch it, the paper bouncing off his finger tips a few times before he finally snatched it about thirty feet from the ground.
	Paul wanted to go sit in the car.  He scanned the crowd nervously, flinching away from the endless ribbon of faces.  The town milled like ants around him and he had no place to put himself that was out of the way.  He stepped nervoulsy back and forth attempting to allow everyone to move in the direction they wanted without blocking them - he wished he could shut off the matter of his body and still be there without taking up space.  And then there was a face that he recognized.  Rebekkah floated listlessy through the stream of people, and then, like at school - eye contact, and she changed course to walk towards him.
	To say that this is exactly what Paul had feared would be partially true.  The feeling contradicted sense, he knew, but in his mind the idea of seeing Rebekkah again, of talking to her, was overwhelmingly recognizable as fear.  The layer of excitement that covered it was a thin gel coating over a pill that had been in his mouth too long now to swallow.
	“Paul!  Hey!”  Rebekkah made a move with her arms like she might try to hug him - she didn’t, she was just adjusting her purse.  She struggled to re-align it on her should while holding an Orange Julius in the other hand.
	“Who is this?!”  Peter knew exactly who it was, and as the two introduced themselves, Paul attempted to construct an escape plan.
	“Paul’s told me a lot about you.”
	Oh god Peter, please, stop, Paul attempted to communicate with his eyebrows.
	“ALRIGHT EVERYONE, KAREN IS HERE, WE’RE READY TO GET STARTED”  The man on the throne cleared his throat and tapped the stack of papers on his knees.  “THANKS EVERYONE FOR COMING.  MY NAME IS ROBERT.  I’M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE END OF THE WORLD IS BEGINING TODAY.”
	In the distance Paul could hear someone shouting.
	“WHAT?  THAT . . . NO, THERE ARE . . . PESTILENCE?  NO, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL WE GET ORGANIZED.  ALL WE ARE DOING TODAY ARE NUMBERS.”
	Everyone looked generally confused.  There was more shouting.
	“JESUS?  NO, I ALREADY SAID, I’M ROBERT.  SORRY, I AM NO LONGER TAKING QUESTIONS.  LISTEN, THIS IS GOING TO TAKE FOREVER IF YOU ARE NOT QUIET.”
	The crowd finally accepted this and stood quitely as Robert sorted through his stack of papers.  
	“OK.  ALEXANDRIA ADKINS: 16.  AMANDA ADKINS: 14.  ANGEL ARCHULETTA: 432 1/3.  DONALD AV - I HEAR WHISPERING.  PLEASE BE - WHAT’S THAT?  WHAT DO THEY MEAN?”
	The people nodded thankfully at whoever had posed this question.  
	“THEY ARE YOUR ASSESMENT NUMBERS.  I TAKE YOUR PAPERWORK -” Robert held a giant piece of paper towards the crowd, like a children’s book at story time.  The paper had writing on it, but it was in some unregognizable language.  The strange text was interspersed with numbers, which had been annotated in pen with long division worked out by hand.  “- I RUN THE NUMBERS, AND GIVE YOU THE RESULT.  PLEASE REMEMBER YOUR NUMBER.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THE COMING WEEKS.”
	Frantically, the people began searching for pens, scraps of paper, anything to jot their number onto.  
	“Oh no . . . ”  Rebekkah tore frantically through her purse for something to write with.  “I have . . . lotion.”
	Paul produced a pen from his pocket.  He had put it in there after writing in his notebook the past night.  
	“Yesssss ok, we can just write it on our hands I guess.” 
	Robert had started in alphabetical order, but it had become apparent that some of his papers had gotten out of order.
	“MONICA LAMBERT:  4/8THS.  . . . . NO, THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS ONE HALF.  PLEASE, EVERYONE, DO NOT REDUCE YOUR FRACTIONS.”
	“So Paul,” Rebekkah spoke nervously around the loud announcements.  “I - I didn’t see you leave yesterday.”
	“JIL TAYBOR:  -43/8.”
	“Ah, yes . . . I'm sorry, I just . . .”
	Paul’s way of interacting with people may not have always made sense to everyone, but they at least understood it enough to comply.  No one had ever needed any further exposition on why Paul left places suddenly, or never showed up to them at all. 
	“RODNEY PITTMAN:  1,500.”
	“It’s totally ok, I was just happy that you showed up.  It was good seeing someone I recognized in with all the homeschooled kids.  I was actually reall afraid it was going to be a disaster but everyone got along, and we got everything planted.”  Rebekkah stared despondantly at the giant man on the throne.  “Though now I guess I wonder if that even matters.”
	The way she stood there, still, just starring off made Paul ache to know what thoughts ran through her head.
	“PETER HOLLIS: 11”  
	Peter nodded and drew a giant 11 on his hand.
	“Why'd you draw it upside down?” Rebekkah asked.
	“It’s right side up . . .” Peter insisted, extending his closed fist towards her so that she could read it.
	“PAUL HOLLIS: 1”
	“OooOOooh, wow.” Rebekkah cheered.  “I think.  I mean, I have no idea what that even means.”
	“Yeah, no clue.” Paul said as he sketched a large 1 onto his hand.  
	“Alright, I’ll be back.” Peter announced.  A nearby Sonic drive through was playing The Beach Boys, so Peter decided it was about time for a chili cheese dog.  
	“Your brother seems nice.” Rebekkah commented.  “That was your brother, right?”
	“Yeah, no, that was him.”
	“I thought he looked familiar.  He went to our school, right?”
	“Yeah, he graduated last year.”
	“He in college?”
	“No.”
	“Working then?”
	“Not really.  Its hard to explain.”
	“SARAH BARNER:  -1117.”
	Rebekkah nodded.
	“Our parents, they travel a lot?  And they just send us money, when we need it.”
	“Oh wow, that’s pretty sweet.  But I imagine its hard when they're away, for like, days.”
	“Actually, we haven’t seen them since Peter graduated.  They came back for that.”
	“Seriously?”
	“Yeah.”
	“Like . . . almost a year?”
	“Yeah.”
	“How do you guys, like . . . if you need signatures sometimes, or . . .”
	“There’s a system.  We mail them stuff.  They mail it back.  We can take care of ourselves.”
	“That’s really intense.”
	Paul shrugged.  “I don’t know, I like it.”  
	“JEFFERY WILLIAMS: 23.5678.”
	“I actually know exactly what you mean.” Rebekkah nodded.  “I live with my dad, and - yeah, I definitely wouldn’t mind that situation.”
	“Is he here?”
	“Yeah, somewhere.  He called me.  I walked here this morning, before he was even up.”
“Wait - ” Paul pointed to the drink in her hand.  “Were you -”
	“Yeah, I got really lucky.  I had seriously just bought this, and I decided to go check out the pet store?  And right then, BAM!”  Rebekkah shook her purse violently to illustrate.  “Everything was coming apart.  I ran for the emergenceny exit and, here we are.” Rebekkah smiled and did a little mock-courtsey.
	“Jesus.” Paul said, shaking his head.  “Now THAT is intense.  Actually intense.”
	“Where were you when it happened?”
	“Oh - I was making pancakes.”
	“Ok, I was going to say,” Rebekkah pointed to the splotches of brown on Paul’s shirt, “You kind of smell like an Ihop.”
	“Yes, I suppose I do.”  
	“Its ok, I like pancakes.”  
	  
	
	Peter watched Paul and Rebekkah from the line at Sonic.  Most of the people working there had been called already, and had no problem serving him now.  The boy taking his order had added ‘38’ to the end of his nametag.
	“38?  nice.  11.”
	“Sweet.”
	“My brother Paul over there?  Number 1.”
	“Damn, I heard that one get called.  Is that good?”
	Peter shrugged.  “That girl standing next to him?  He’s trying to flirt with her.  Its so painful to watch.”
	“Yeah?  Why don’t you help him?”
	“I don’t know what to tell him.  I’m personally really good at meeting girls, it just comes naturally to me, so I don’t know how to help him.”
	“Well we're just better at that, right?”
	“What do you mean we?”
	“You’re - you’re Peter Hollis right?  We went - well, I still go to Liberty High School - and I heard,”  The scanned the back room a bit. “I mean . . . because we're gay.” 	
	“What the fuck did you just say?”  Peter gripped the counter hard, peeling up the veneer of the countertop a little.
	“I just - I thought you were out . . .”
	“I am NOT fucking gay.  ”
	“It wasn’t an insult, I just thought -”
	“Well you thought wrong you fucking queer, and you tell anyone else who want to call me that to come and fucking find me, I am at the gym every morning you fucking pansy.”  Peter took the hotdog without paying for it, ate it as quickly as possible while walking away, and threw the box it came in onto the street far away from a trashcan.  
	
	“REBEKKAH ROTEM: 168.”
	Rebekkah jotted the main form of the numbers down on her hand, then proceeded to fill them in with decorative vines.  
	“Is there a chance you could drive me home?” Rebekkah asked.  “With everything going on, I don’t really want to walk back alone, you know?”
	“Yeah, I’m sure Peter will be fine with that.  I wonder where he went . . .”
	“NOT YET, PAUL, NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LEAVE UNTIL WE GET THROUGH EVERYONE.”

	The exercise took all day.  Even after the numbers had been finished several people had already managed to forget theirs - as a result, the sun was begining to wane as Robert started from the top of the list again.
	“So by this point, I can barely breathe, and I'm running like my legs are broken.  It's been over twenty minutes, the rest of the class is just sitting in the grass watching me.”
	Rebekkah was laughing hard internally, but was trying to keep a straight face for Paul’s sake.  
	“It's ok, you can laugh.”
	The two had found been given a tussle of blankets by a store owner that believed the sun would never rise again, and had wanted to at least make the people near his store comfortable as the inevitable judgement of his deeds began.  Paul and Rebekkah had balled it up against a stone embankment and now leaned comfortably with their back again it, watching the sun setting behind Robert like a living movie screen.
	“So, then I started crying.”
	“Stoooop this is so bad!”
	“So I'm taking so long to finish, the coach doesn’t realize the bell has rung - so out comes the girl’s class, to me just hobbling and crying around the track.”
	“Ok ok, you win.”
	“I bet you feel better about tripping at homecoming, right?”
	“No, that was still really bad.  You don’t know what it’s like to be a girl.”
	“I'm glad, it sounds like everything comes to a grinding halt every time you make a mistake.”
	Rebekkah sighed.  “Yeah, that’s not too far off.”
	Peter had not been spotted in quite some time.  Truth be told he had calmed down considerably and was now searching for Paul and Rebekkah, who had only moved about ten feet to the right.  When he finally saw them he was a bit put off by how little concern they seemed to exhibit regarding his roughly six hour hiatus.  
	“Well I was a little concerned about you guys.”
	“Well you could have texted me.  You were the one that went wandering off.”  Paul scooted away from Rebekkah so that Peter could sit between them.  Peter shook his head and pushed Paul back towards her, sitting on the outside of them instead.  It was a silly gesture - even before he'd shown up the two sat spaced apart like siblings.  
	
	Finally around seven o’clock the last of the numerical confusion had been cleared up, and Robert moved into his closing remarks.  
	“EVERYONE!” Robert announced anthemically, at last retiring his paperwork to a giant manilla folder and shoving it into the crevice of the throne cushion.  “DON’T FORGET YOUR NUMBERS.  I SUGGEST WRITING THEM DOWN IN MULTIPLE PLACES, IN CASE YOU FORGET, OR YOUR ONLY COPY IS DESTROYED IN A FIRE.  MAYBE FIND A REMINDER BUDDY.  I WILL BE BACK WHEN I GET EVERYTHING SORTED OUT, AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT COMES NEXT.  PLEASE TAKE CARE UNTIL THEN.  I MEAN IT.  DON'T FORGET YOUR NUMBERS.”
	WIth that, Robert’s throned levitated off the North side of the mall and rose steadily into the sky, until eventually he dissapeared out of sight.  
	Since he'd insisted on dismissing everyone at once, traffic was a nightmare.  Peter was fine with taking Rebekkah back, but reaching his car was its own sort of surreal journey.  Everywhere people ran through the streets looking for this person or another, or simply talking to others about the numbers, in a sort of fluster like the whole world was on vacation and for this moment the delicate fabric of social conduct could be skewed to one’s liking.  Everywhere along the journey back people stood outside of homes and places of business as if the power had gone out and there was no point in returning to whatever they had been doing.  A man dressed as a waiter handed Peter a champagne flute, and smiling, began to fill it.
	“Are we celebrating?” Peter asked.
	“We're not sure.” the man replied.  Car horns blarred out in the night like trumpets announcing the arrival of some undefined understanding.
	The troupe was about to their car when Paul and Rebekkah spotted a familiar face along the side of the road.  On the patio of a small ice cream parlor Jacob sat, eating a waffle cone with no ice cream inside of it.  He wore a long sleeve blue cardigan, and the same ridiculous plastery haircut.  In front of him on the table sat a plastic back of at least twelve more cones inside.
	“Oh!  Oh!  Rebekkah, and Peter!” Jacob waved frantically to them.  
	“Ya’ll want some ice cream?” a man called from inside the shop.
	“I think we're fine!” Peter called back.
	“Have you guys checked on the carrots yet?  Are they doing ok?”
	“Its only been a day, Jacob.” Rebekkah replied.  “I don’t think they're doing anything yet.”
	“Oh.  Hey, have you guys ever had ice cream?  I don’t understand the name but they taste delicious.”  Jacob knawed frantically through the tip of a second cone.
	“Are you here with someone?  Did you walk?”
	“Oh, my family drove me,” Jacob explained, “But when we got there, you will not believe this - the whole time, all they wanted to do was pray.  Facing eachother!  Not even watching!  I honestly - I couldn’t do it.  There was so much going on, and they wanted me to close my eyes!  So, I booked it.”
	“Booked it?”
	“Make a run for it.  I've just been running around since.  Talking to people.  Looking at things.  You know I never get the chance to do this - see they've only recently given me outside priviledges since I’ve turned eighteen.”
	“Your parents?”
	“Yes.  In our family, anyone under eighteen can only go out with the family as a whole.  We usually go out on every other saturday, for a hike or something.”  Jacob started cone number three.  “But I’ll tell you, if I would have known that there was - all this out here - I would have started soooo much sooner, this whole booking it thing.”
	“Those’ll make you sick if you eat too many.” Paul warned him.
	“Really?  What are they made from?”
	“I’m pretty sure its just fried batter.”
	“Is that bad?” Jacob asked, staring blankly at the ten other cones in the bag.
	“Did you get your number?” Rebekkah asked.
	“Oh, did I.”  Jacob removed his cardigan, revealing a number written upside down from one wrist to the other, right across his chest:  90,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
	“Wow.  Is that written in - lipstick?”
	“Yes, a nice lady let me borrow it.”  Jacob began to nibble at a fourth cone, this time with what seemed like restraint following Paul’s input.
	“Well we're all on our way home Jacob, would you like a ride?”  Rebekkah offered.  “Is that ok Peter?”
	“Sure, you live far?”
	“Nope, just -” Jacob pointed off into the distance.  “That way I think.”

	Rebekkah’s stop was first - she lived in roughly the same neighborhood as Paul and Peter, though the traffic made this short trip almost an hour in length.  
	“Here is fine.” Rebekkah said, pointed to what appeared to be a random street corner.  “My dad is - really weird about people, and if he sees me pulling up in a car . . . it’s just easier for me to walk the rest of the way.  I just live up the street.”
	“Fair enough.” Peter said, pulling the car up to the sidewalk.  As Rebekkah exited the car the street lights were just beginning to come on again, and Paul wondered if his window pointed this direction, if some of the streetlights he saw from his window at night were hers.
	“Oh!  Almost forgot.  Paul, you should have my number, and visa verca.”  Rebekkah motioned for him to hand her his phone.  “We’re going to water the garden over the summer, so don’t think you’re off the hook.”  Rebekkah tapped her number into the phone, until her purse began to light up and vibrate.  “Jacob, you already have my number right?”
	“Indeed I do.”
	“Alright then.  Boys, have a nice night!”  She called as she turned to make her way down the dark street.

	Jacob’s stop took much longer.  Around 10pm he made out what he thought to be the back of his house, over the top of a tall vynl fence.
	“Are you SURE this time?” Peter asked, focusing his frustration into the limited padding on the steering wheel.  “If you knock again and its not them, we’re calling you a cab or something.  Those people, they were . . . aggressive.”
	“I told you, I knew that wasn’t the place, I just thought they might know where we were going.  Yes, I’m very sure that time.  See that rock?  The big one on the corner?  I've definitely seen it before.”
	“Before tonight?”
	“Yep.  Plenty of times.”
	Jacob had Peter slow to to front of the large fence, a tall vinyl barricade that had to be at least 10 feet tall.  
	“Thanks for everything!” Jacob said, exiting the vehicle.  “Sorry I didn't know where I live.”
	“It happens.” Peter said, his hand on the shifter.
	Jacob approached the large gate of the fence, and pressed a buzzer.
	“Who is it?  Jacob?” crackled a voice through an aging metal speaker box.  
	“It is.  I'm sorry. I became lost.”
	“You RAN AWAY.  All of a sudden you turn eighteen and you think the world is your playground!”  Muffled voices and bickering could be heard in the background.  “We’ll let him in when he understands what he did.”
	“This could take a while.” Jacob warned Peter and Paul.  “You should go.”
	“Ok.” Peter said, pushing the gas to the floor.
	“That fucking kid.” Paul said as the car accelerated into the the now black night.  “THAT was the guy I was telling you about.”
	“No, I picked up on that.  Especially after he wouldn’t stop talking about the damn carrots.  Christ.”
	
	By this time Rebekkah had been writing in her diary for almost two hours.  She had needed a head start, she had a lot to write that night.  Once again I can tell you only parts of what she wrote - it began with

	168

	Went on for several pages, and then ended with

	I am not a princess

	Over and over again.  When Paul and Peter got home, they were both understandably exhausted - still, Paul found time to write

	1

	In his notebook, afterwhich he starred at it for a long time.  There’s no telling how long, since there are no clocks in his room.  But after this relatively long time, Paul wrote

	I will never call her, and she will never call me, and I will never see her again.

	Then curled into a ball and fell asleep.

            <Text>Chapter 5 - Back to the Garden


	Jacob’s father grabbed the ceramic bowl in front of him up off the table and this time slammed it into the cabinent so forecfully that it risked breaking others by association.  Jacob stood silently and walked to another cabinent to retrieve a tupperware bowl.  He set it on his placemat and sat down at his place, at a large wooden table with his seven terrified siblings, all clutching their matching bowls closely in fear.  Dust particles fluttered around the room, stirred from the comotion, visible only in the tiny beams of warm morning light that came in through the slightly open windows of Jacob’s kitchen.  The house was never open, even on nice days like this, and the stagnant air only heightened the chocking atmosphere of the room.
	“Alright.  Maybe you haven’t lied to me, but you’ve left out a great deal of important details.”
	“Is this about the ice cream still?”  Jacob’s mother was more sympathetic, but was still baffled by her son’s sudden change in behavoir.  “We’ve only kept the things from you that might hurt you Jacob, that’s a priviledge.”
	“Our family is privaledged!” his father picked up.  “Do you think freedom is what you want?  What about safety, Jacob?  You’ve been guarded here too long to understand how dangerous the rest of the world is.  We are keeping you safe, something you wouldn’t be able to do yourself.”  Jacob opened his mouth to speak, to which his father quickly imposed, “You were lucky yesterday, that is all!”  He was a thunderous, large man, his hair greyed and worn thin.  His footsteps around the table shook the silverware off of the folded cloth napkins.  Jacob held the bowl close to him so that his father couldn’t snatch it.  
	“Listen, the things you saw - the things you say you saw - they need to be put out of your mind.”
	“You still don't believe me?!” Jacob was exasperated.  “There were plenty of girls wearing shorts!  Soft, short, fabric shorts, the likes of which I've never seen!”  He recalled them in his memory as if they were a distant dream. “Some of them said things across the buttocks.  Juicy.  Cheer.  Fabulous.”
	“Tell my Jacob, why would such a garment exist?  They were clearly underwear of some kind!  It was because of Angel Robert, no girl would have ever left the house like that on a day on which the world was not ending.”
	“The world isn’t ending!”  Jacob shouted back.  He could see only a sliver of the sky out the window, over the vinyl fence, but he concentrated on it as he spoke.  “Not that world, out there, there’s too much life in it to die, I just couldn’t believe it.” He watched as his father’s shadow danced on the stone wall of the kitchen in the hot morning light.  “Even if it were, out there I could live three more lives today.  And three more tomorrow.  I could live a thousand more times over before the world has time to end.”
	“Nothing out there is real, Jacob.”  His father lowered himself into a chair, looking for once saddened.  “Your mother and I, we’ve worked hard to give you the realest, most important parts of life and spare you from the extraneous and uneccessary.  The things out there, as beautiful as they may seem now, are not important.  They will only push you further away from what is.” The man rubbed his hands over eachother, wrinked and leathery, hardened from work. 
	“Listen Jacob, we’ve made a decision as a family.  Everyone except you, that is, as you deserted us when we needed eachother the most.  While you were away we decided, the family needs to return to my father's commonality to wait for the end times.  It will be safe there.”
	“It’s safe here!” Jacob slammed his bowl onto the table, producing an unintmidating plastic boing.  “I will not be going with you.  I will be staying here.”
	“Listen Jacob, you know the rules.  You’re eighteen now.  You have a decision to make.  We won’t stand in your way.  But tell me, if not with us, where will you go?”
	Jacob thought back on the people and places he had brushed with in the four days since he had turned eighteen.  Friday had been mostly birthday cake and fanfare.  Saturday had been gardening . . .
	“I will go back to the garden.” Jacob announced.  He stood at his place at the table, then went and returned his bowl to the kitchen cabinet.  
	“Where?” his father asked.
	“Before breakfast?” his mother wanted to know.
	Jacob was already in his room, stuffing clothing into his hiking backpack.  Had his parents known it would one day be used as an escape device they might have thought more seriously about renting the packs instead of buying them.  
	“Only one boy of our name has EVER left at eighteen, and that was to go to university, and even THAT was a waste!  He forgot his values!  He never returned to see his family!”  Jacob’s mother braced herself against the door frame.  “He’s not leaving is he?”  She watched fearfully as the boy packed - shirts, underwear, a Bible . . . a handful of legos. 
	“Edward stop him, he doesn’t know what he's doing!”
	“You're too old to be acting like this Jacob!” his father scolded.  
	Jacob was too far past the idea of stopping.  He scooped a handful of pesonal possesions into the bag and ran to his bedroom window - he flung it open dramatically and pushed through it, knocking the screen out of place.  His parents screamed frantically as he landed face first in the dirt outside, then rolled into a run.  Through the overgrown yard, towards the ten foot high vinyl fence.  Steading his shoulder towards it, he rammed the fence at full speed - the planks bowed, and as Jacob dug his heels into the dirt against them, they snapped out of place and wobbled noisely to the ground.  The fence looked like a grin missing two teeth.  Jacob dissapeared through the gap as his parents watched, helpless, from the boy's room.  


	Paul lied on the couch staring at his ceiling.  A plate beside him held the drying residue of tiny pancake fragments glued together with blots of maple syrup, becoming dry and rubbery in the heat of the day.  The fan blades made a repetitive swish across his face as he watched the shadows of the blades growing and shrinking as they orbited from one side of the room to the other.

	Their shoulders had brushed once.  Paul had scooted a bit further away out of politeness.  There were no parts Paul felt inclined to change.
	I will never see her again.
		
	Down the hall Paul could hear water running.  He sat up and resigned himself to one side of the couch as Peter made his way into the kitchen, scavanging for food.
	“Did you make extra?”
	“No, I wasn’t sure when you’d be up.”
	“Damn.  Poptarts then I guess . . . Hey so is there anything on the news about yesterday?”
	This was the first time Paul had thought to check.  As the TV screen glowed into cohesion a frantic news scene began to solidify - a picture of a US map focused into view with hundreds of tiny Robert-shaped markers scattered about it.  “What we do know,” said a man standing beside the map, “Is that every city we’ve been able to contact has confirmed that they too recieved a visit from a large man on a throne named Robert, who warned them of the Rapture and assigned them numbers.  So far that's nearing 2.2 million Roberts yesterday.”
	“Thanks Tim.”  an anchorwoman offered.  “Mark Koebrick is on location at the site of Robert’s landing yesterday; Mark, can you give us an idea of what it’s like out there?”
	“Sure Kim, as I said earlier, not a lot of new developments to report.”  Mark stood near where Paul and Rebekkah had sat the day before, cameras pointed towards the grizzly wreckage of the good side of the mall.  “We still have many religious groups holding vigil, as well as a few curious onlookers, just waiting to see if ‘Robert’ is coming back.  Still a lot of question and mystery surrounding yesterday’s event.  Here’s what we do know:”
	An obviously pre-recorded segment began to play.
	“Numbers, numbers, numbers.” a dubbed voice announced, as video panned across footage of yesterday’s crowd.  “We’ve all got one.  But what do they mean?”
	An old couple with a microphone aimed at them appeared on screen.
	“I think it's pretty obvious,” Earl Walters explained, looking over to Margaret Walters every few words.  “Mr. Robert, as he’d like us to call him, was an Angel of Our Lord, like he said.  He came to weigh our sins, and has given us numbers based off of that.  Looks to us like the higher your number is, the better you’d been.  Father Michaels got what, a - something in the thousands!”  The two beamed proudly.  “Me an Margaret both got in the seven hundreds, she’s been a bit better than me.” Earl chuckled, rubbing an open palm on Margaret’s back.  “But we decided that isn’t too bad, what with all the fractions given out.”
	The narration began again.  “The Walter’s suspicions of a ‘divine rating system’ is a common one, but one that seems to vary from person to person.”
	A tall, thin, ebony-skinned man appeared on screen, staring blankly in the general direction of the camera.  On his shirt written in sharpie was the number -78.3.
	“The Lord’s game is one of weight!” he shouted, as if he were addressing not only the cameraman directly, but maybe some people behind him.  “It is said in Revalation that in the end days we will be weighed and that those who are found heavy with sin will experience the second death.  But there is time to save yourself from these forthecoming firey lakes of sulfur!  If you notice, I have room to spare.  I am looking to help some with a weight of 78.3, or lower.  This is how God has planned it, for it is through each other that we are saved.”
	“Still,” continued the voiceover, “Others insist the numbers don’t mean anything.”
	A group of teenage girls stood sipping Frappacinos in a semi-circle, facing the camera.  
	“I don’t know, it doesn’t look like anything’s changed.” one girl said, squinting off into the distance.  “I forgot my number already.  It was pretty small.  Sarah’s was, Sarah what was your -”
	“58!”
	“And Ashley’s was”
	“348.9!”
	“And Laura’s was . . . . where did Laura go?”
	“-10 and 29/34ths.”
	“Wow, that is RED-iculous.”

	“Still, regardless of what people may think they mean, most people seem proud to show them off.”
	Several clips shot at different areas of the mall the previous night showed people offering their numbers to the camera, written on body parts and clothing, some forming numerical lines and inspecting the results.  The camera turned back to the newscaster standing in the now all but empty mall parking lot.  
	“So that’s the scene out here.  Erica?”
	“Thanks Mark.” said a woman back in the newsroom.  “Real interesting stuff.  A memorial service will be held this weekend to remember those that were killed in the mall collapse yesterday.  A spokesperson for the Lakeline Mall has said that they are, ‘deeply sorry’ for the loss of life that occurred, but that the mall was simply not built to hold the weight of a giant man on a throne.  The impending lawsuits are expected to be written off as an act of god.”
	“Whataya think?” Peter asked casually.  “You want to go find that dude, have him take your point away?”
	“Yeah, what does - how does he expect to tell?  What does he think he’s going to do?”
	Peter shrugged.  “People are fucking crazy man.  Surprised nobody’s gotten killed yet.”

	Jacob stood proudly in the center of the garden; inhaled a deep, happy breath.  
	“I’m home!” he announced to the bed of dirt.  “Where can I sleep where I won’t disturb any of your growing?”
	Jacob was becoming concerened that not a single sprout had started to poke out yet, and felt a faint concern that at this rate, he might not have food for tomorrow night.  
	“Hey, how’d you get in here?”  The voice came from behind Jacob.  Turning, he saw four young boys standing at the gate of the garden.  They were younger than Jacob, maybe thirteen, on average - they each walked a bike into the garden where Jacob stood, in a sort of semi-circle around him.
	“You're not from our neighborhood.” said perhaps the oldest-looking boy - a bit chubby but with a piercing, serious glare.  “We gotta check you.”
	“Check for what?” Jacob asked.
	“Your number.  We need to know what your number is.”
	“Oh, nine times ten to the forty third power!  What’s yours?”
	“It’s what?”
	“Nine times - it’s a nine followed by forty three zeros.”
	The boys shook their heads dissaprovingly.  “No way, that’s way too high.  You can’t stay here.”
	“You're confused.” Jacob explained.  “See, I’ll be living here now.  It all happened this morning when I -”  
	“NO, you won’t.” insisted the chubby boy, letting his bike lean against the chainlink fence around the garden’s perimeter.  The three other boys followed suit, standing in what they felt were tough-looking poses behind him.  “Tell ‘em Jon.” a short boy called from the back.
	“See this neighborhood?” Jon pointed into the arches of great oaks that opened to the back of the school.  “Every single one of us here, every family, got a number under 20. You catch my drift, old man?”
	Jacob shook his head.
	“Of course not.  You in your fancy little rich kid clothes, prolly never notice us.  But God did.  He set this whole neighborhood apart so that people like you can’t bother us no more.  1 - 20, all whole numbers an’ shit.  What’d you call ‘em George?”
	“Integers.”
	“Yeah, fuckin’ integers.  That’s what we are.  What Robert did, he seperated us so we can have peace finally.  Fuckin first stops aren’t allowed here anymore.”
	“Fuckin first stop!” one of the boys yelled.  Jon had never made more sense to them.  
	“You know, we have to deal with ones like you every morning, all year.  Sittin in the back, throwin shit at us.  Last stops are always gettin the shit seats and the shit treatment by people like you.  That’s why you’re not passing through anymore.  You find a different school where you can be last stop, and stop trolling through here.”
	“I have nowhere to go.” Jacob explained.  He was unsure but it felt like the boys were tightening the semi-circle around him.  His feet had found their way from the lettuce to the first row of arugula.  
	“I don’t need all the zeros.” Jacob stammered.  “You can have some.  We can share them.”
	“You think that's what matters here?”  Jon was turning red and sweaty.  “Listen, I’ll tell you one more time.  Leave.  Now.”
	Jacob felt the loose soil shift beneath his feet as his heels scraped the concrete curb of the back wall.  The carrots - he was standing right on the carrots.
	“No,” Jacob said, locking eyes with Jon.  “This is my garden, and I'm staying.”


The camera was showing a different area of town now, where a man with ‘9,999’ written in sharpie across his chest and a bat in his hand stood in front of a preschool.  Paul and Peter lay dormant on the couch, absorbed in the steady stream of new developments.
“A few updates - first, police have confirmed that the man in front of ____ day care center is demanding to see his daughter, having cited his assesment number as a point that may overturn his child custody case, previously closed in March.  
	“Only ten blocks away, a local grocer’s market has all but shut down as the owner refuses to sell to anyone with a negative number.  This denial of service has sparked outrage for many long time customers who say they have no other alternative for their daily needs.  This is just one of many instances both locally and internationally that has started the debate of whether denying services to someone because of their number is a form of descrimination.”

	Peter nonchalantly got up and walked to the front door, making sure the deadbolt was secure.  He looked out the window.  The street was it’s typical placid self - a woman walked her dog, swinging a plastic water bottle in her hand with each jogging step.  Some sprinklers spit frantically onto the lawn of the house across the street.  

	“Well, I mean, definitely.” said a young officer standing outside the supermarket.  “But he owns the market, and has the right to refuse service to pretty much anyone.  Now, if he was descriminating by race, or gender, there’s a number of laws we could enforce to ensure equal treatment.  But with nothing on the books regarding the numbers, we can’t legally interfere.  It’s wrong, definitely, but we really can't do anything besides ensure that no one's getting hurt, or anything like that.”

	Paul’s pocket began to vibrate.  Retrieving his phone he tried to mentally place the number with no name attached to it - same area code, but completely foreign in all other respects.
	“Hello?”
	“Paul?  Is this Paul?”
	“Yeah, who is -”
	“This is Rebekkah, I’m on the move.  I need you to - could you and Peter come pick me up?”
	Paul shot a paniced look to Peter who still stood at the front window, pulling a lacy curtain out of the way to watch the street.  “Who’s that?”
	“Sorry, I did NOT explain this very well,”  Rebekkah continued, the sound of panting and hurried footsteps puntuating her sentances.  “So Jacob just called me.  He's in the hospital.  Aparently I'm the only person he had to call.”
	“Is he alright?”
	“Sorta, I think - I was going to go see him, and I didn’t want to get my dad involved - but the hospital I guess is really far away.  And he was looking for you anyway.  So I guess I'm saying, what are the chances,” the audio became muffled by a dense scuffling sound, “that you, and Peter, want to come pick ME up, wherever I am, and take me to the hospital, so I can check on Jacob?”
	“Paul!”  Peter called, his eyes still transfixed out the window, “That girl Rebekkah just ran out of the bush across the street.”  Paul ran to the window, where a few yards away Rebekkah stood in the middle of the street, phone to ear, staring blankly up and down the block.

	“So he . . . hurt himself?  How?”  Peter looked at Rebekkah in the rearview mirror, anxiously tapping out a message on her phone.
	“Not a clue.  His voice was really muffled and then he had to hang up.  Now he’s just sending me these garbled texts, they’re not even words.”  Rebekkah leaned forward and showed the her phone to Paul - 

	Di but djrry since, HB bury utter siyif very great ignore boy xuyjd xibr axhst bday.

	Paul shook his head, in no way looking forwart to what bizzare interaction awaited him at the hospital.  Once again he sat a few feet from Rebekkah, unshowered and unsure of what to say.  The gradual and unexpected comfort he had found with her the previous day was lost, seemingly reset to the silent default he greeted strangers with.  A few times he opened his mouth slightly, attempting to coax an intelligible string of words.  Each time, he shut it again and sunk a bit lower in his seat.
	“Do you think it has something to do with the numbers?”  Peter wondered out loud.  “People are fucking crazy today.”
	“Yeah, and actually I was going to ask about the bat.” Rebekkah pointed to the steel Loiuseville slugger Peter held between his leg and the center console of the car.
	“Jeez, you and Paul both.  He was like, begging me not to bring it.  You see the news?  Paul’s one number away from not being able to buy oranges in this neighboorhood.”  Peter scanned the streets methodically as he drove for possible sources of threat.  Nothing looked terribly out of place.  No one near his age.  He had the faint rumble of double bass and shrieking guitars playing out of the speakers just in case.  

	The nurses had not wanted the bat in the hospital, but Peter had insisted.  He tucked the handle into his belt, and explained the thing about the oragnes to her as they walked down the hall to the section Jacob had been set up in.
	“We’ve had a lot of bat-related injuries today, is all.”  The nurse commented as it swung precariously at his side with each step.  “Your friend for instance - we though it might have been something like that at first, but now they’re thinking it was just fists.  But a lot of them.”
	“He got beat up?” Rebekkah hung close to the nurse, walking at times ahead of her.  
	“Preeetty bad.  He’s ok, he just needed a whole mess of stitches.”  She led the group into a room room and motioned to what was probably Jacob, sitting upright in a bed.  His entire face, as well as his forearms, were covered in thick white bandages.  
	“Your friends are here.”  the nurse called to Jacob, who scanned the room like an animatronic bear at Showbizz Pizza.
	“Rebekkah?  Paul?”
	“And Peter, he’s here too.  Oh Jacob . . .” she whinced, getting a closer look at the cuts and bruises the prodtruded from the bandaged areas of his arms and face.  “What happened?”
	For a moment Jacob was quiet - actually quiet.  
	“Did you get in a fight?” she asked.
	“I went back to the garden.”  Jacob explained.  “But it was nothing like the first time.  None of the people there were friendly.”
	“Well it wasn’t the same people,”  Rebekkah explained, “Not everyone is going to be friendly to you, like we were.”
	“Lotta fucking nutjobs out there, especially today.” Peter said.  “What were you even doing out there?”
	Jacob shook his head defeadedly.  “I had a choice,” he explained.  “To either stay with my family and return to my uncle’s commonality or to set off on my own.”
	“So you went to the garden?”
	“I thought it would have the best accomodations.  It was that or the ice cream parlor from last night.”
	“Yeah, they're not going to let you live in either of those places.” Peter said.  “No offense man, but you don’t really seem prepared for this.”
	“I feel similarily.”  Jacob sighed.  “I thought I would not need a home, in the traditional sense.  But now I am unsure and I have left mine, and cannot return.”
	“Why not?  I remember where you live.”
	“Because the choice had already happened!”  Jacob shouted.  No expression was aparent from beneath his bandages, but the air held a palpatable tension as the group stood silently beside the shaken nurse.  “I never really had a say in it.”  Jacob said, restoring his voice.  “It wasn’t a choice at all.  The moment I stepped out of my house, into the garden - I knew a part of me could never go back inside, to the way I had be living before.  I came out here and I experienced in two days more than I had in my entire lifetime.  And just because it is harder, or more painful, does not change the fact that I can’t go back now, to pretending that I don’t know what lies outside the walls of my home.  It changed me.”  Jacob held his white-tied arms up to his face, long strands of his disheveled hair falling over the tops of the bandages.  “And though the transformation is not complete, it cannot be stopped now, what has started.  I am a different person now.”  
	He traced a finger up and down his cheek bone.  “It’s funny but, the pain - I kind of liked it.  It was my own.  Does that make sense?”
	“It does.” Paul said.
	“Paul, there you are.  I was begining to doubt your presence.  I want you to know that the radishes are fine.  And the carrots.”
	“That's good,” Paul insisted earnestly, “but you know you can’t live there.”
	Jacob nodded.  “It appears not.  I have to - ” Jacob shook his head - “How do you get a house?  If I were to knock, and offer a price -”
	“I think you’re a few steps away from that one.”  Rebekkah interjected.  “You need someone you can stay with until you get your feet on the ground.”  Her sweet, deep eyes turned to Paul and Peter.  “It just so happens, Paul was telling me that since his parents are away, he has lots of space -”
	“Weellll, LOTS of space, I don’t know -” Peter began, but was stuttered to a halt when Rebekkah’s eyes turn to tangental discs.  She mouthed instructions silently, clearly - 

YOU
TAKE
HIM
IN

“ . . . Sure, you can come stay for . . . a bit.”  Peter’s eyebrows negotiated with Rebekkah’s gritted teeth - “For . . . as long as you need.  But realistically, how out of reach is an apartment for you?”
	“So it’s settled.” Rebekkah clapped her hands once deftly.  “How much longer do you need to be here?”
	“He can leave now,” the nurse said, “He just needs some help until the bandages come off.  Probably a week.”
	“We’re on it.” Rebekkah said, offering a hand to Jacob, who lied motionless in the bed.
	“I am not sure I am ready.”  Jacob let his head fall backward into the pillow behind him.  “The world requires more of me than I had thought.  If I am going to live here, I am going to need to be different.  Being Jacob is not enough.”
	“I don’t think that’s true.”  Rebekkah sat down softly on the bed near Jacob’s knees.  “It took a lot of something to leave home.  To go to the garden, fight for what you wanted.  There’s strength inside of you, or none of that would have happened.”
	“If that’s true, I don’t feel it.”  Jacob said.  “Do I look like strong?  Like I have something inside of me?”
	Truth be told, Jacob didn’t look like anything.  The bandages hinted subtely at shapes, like the face of a maneqquin.
	“Ok, I've got this,”  Peter announced, “I know where we’re going next.”


	The people that stood on sidewalks and parking lots passing by Paul’s car window sorted themselves into categories.  The news programs in the morning had helped and now he saw three distint groups:

	1.  The Hunters
	These were the people Jacob had met, and who occupied the news that morning.  The numbers had made them outwardly and inwardly critical, and they sought to make sense of them forecefully and immediately.  Passing a Best Buy Paul could see a group of men carrying boxes upon boxes out while balancing make-shift weapons in a free hand - garden tools, hatchets, pocket knives - while the store attendees stood around aimlessly, helpless as their stock slowly hemorraged from the sliding double doors.

	2.  The Hiders
	Paul wanted to be in this group.  They were at home, watching the events play out on television, behind locked doors.  Maybe they were inwardly critical too, but they felt no need to show it.

	3.  The Indifferent
	This is the group Paul had been more or less thrust in to by his brother, who drove through the commercial district searching for a shop he had visited once and could not remember the exact location of.  They filled parking lots and shops, behaving normally but cautiously, attempting to shake and dismiss the events as a helpless aberation in their otherwise normal lives.  Life was normal, still, despite outward appearances - nothing had changed any more than you allowed it too.

	“Ok ok here we are.”  Peter pulled his car up beside one of several shops lining an old neighborhood road - the entrance, the entire length of the store was decorated with large skulls made of plastic, plaster, some as tall as the door.  Chicken wire wrapped over them and held articles bundles of bones, staffs, and plastic weapons, beneath a large hand-painted sign which read in old-style serif - “Flossy McGrew’s”.
	“Jacob!” Peter announced to the skeptical crowd.  “You need to become someone.  Someone different.  We're going to go in here, and turn you into a different person.  Grandma Goth is going to help.”
	The store's inside was packed, wall ceiling and floor, with costumes, jewelry, accessories; and so many other types of various things that it was hard to see them as individual items instead of a giant growth of color.  The dim, expansive interior smelt vaguely of incense and was quiet save for the distant scattered ruffling of fabric.  
	“Where’s Grandma Goth?” Peter stood at a glass counter, behind which a tall man with a beard was affixing individual price tags to a pile of scarves.
	“We don’t know.” he replied, not even looking up.  “We haven’t seen her since Robert came.”
	“Oh.” Peter looked a little saddened by the news.  “Is she ok?”
	The man shrugged.  “No one knows.”
	Rebekkah walked slowly towards to back of the shop, into a large, ballroom-like expanse filled with circular racks of clothing.  The high arched ceilings faded into complete blackness before reaching their apex, and from where she stood more and more arched entryways were visible, going back and back and back.  Paul walked a row or two behind her.  The dim lights were nice.  The construction lamps that hung from wires looked like street lights over a vacant cloth town.
	“The store didn’t look this deep from outside.”  Rebekkah wandered forward into the dark space, her eyes searching every visible inch.  She turned when she saw a giant mirror, framed by dozens of colored wigs hanging from styrafoam heads.  
	“Peeeeeeerfect . . .” she said, prancing up to inspect them.  She turned to Paul, and with her hand to her chin she studied him, his thin frame covered by more greyish clothes, though different from what he'd been wearing the day before.  Turning back she rifled through the hills of fake hair, at last retrieving a rainbow mohawk wig.
	Paul balanced the monstrosity on his head.  The strands of colors swished back and forth as Rebekkah afixed a neon blue bobcut to herself.
	“I’ve thought about dying my hair blue, you know.”  She brushed the colored locks around her shoulders, shook her head back and forth.  “Or going this short.  I think it would look cute.”
	Paul knew that Rebekkah wasn’t fishing for compliments, but that she would smile if he confirmed her suspicisions that yes, she looked adorable with a neon blue bob, that really anything on top of that face was going to look just fine so long as it didn’t cover her radiant eyes.  Paul knew this.  But he said nothing.  Why?  You tell me why.  Tell Paul why.  The fuse of his tongue longed to ignite a bundle of words in his throat, but some nameless thing kept him perpetually from striking the match.
	“I think I would feel like a whole different person, definitely.  I see where Peter is coming from.”
	Fingering through the wigs, Rebekkah paused, and pulled a sparkling tiara from the back of the wall.  Placing it delicately on her head, she stood back and stared into herself, hand on her elbow.  She gave a little laugh.  
	“This is just too silly.”  She pulled the tiara and wig from her head and placed them back on a dummy scalp.  “Where did Jacob and Peter get off to?”
	Around the corner Jacob and Peter stood before a similar mirror, this one covered in rubber masks.
	“Really Peter!” Jacob protested.  He had slid the bandages around his angry eyes to glare at Peter.  “Is that what you think of me?  A zombie?!”
	“Listen dude, we've got limited options here.  You turned down all the normal ones.  You can either pick a realistic one, or, like, a monster.”
	“THAT is not how it works at all.  There is no such thing as a realistic MASK.  They are all equally unreal.  Our goal should be to find the mask that is unrealistically as real as possible.  Does that make sense?”
	“Not even slightly.”
	“Rebekkah!” Jacob called.  “You understand what I’m saying, don’t you?  The maks must be of me, but only parts of me.  It must be equal parts something else, of the thing I am becoming.”
	“Yeah, I know what you mean.” she replied, taking a handful of masks from Peter.  “And you’re not a zombie, are you?”
	“Hardly.” he said, re-affixing the mask to a mannequinn head.  “Where is the Grandma Goth you spoke of?  Who could help me become someone else?”
	“No one knows where she is.” Peter explained.
	“Did you know her well?” Rebekkah asked.  “Are you worried?”
	“Nah, nah I mean she's a total weirdo.  I only talked to her like, once.  She’s just big on this whole, ‘being yourself’ thing.  I thought she might be able to help.  But I guess you’ll have to decide yourself.  Jacob!  Decide!  What are you now?”
	“No pressure!” Rebekkah added reasuringly.
	Paul had begun to fidget with a large crimson curatin against the wall, attepting to remove himself from the situation until the conflict passed.  Behind it he could see more rows of what looked like they could be masks.  He grabbed the curtain from as high up as he could and attempted to move the ringlets across the pole, but it seemed to be caught on something.  Giving the whole thing perhaps too hard a yank, the curtain split and ripped vertically from top to bottom.
	“Whoa buddy, don’t go tearing shit up.  I know you’re getting atnsy.”
	“THAT.”  Jacob pointed at what the panel had revealed behind the curtain - a row of African style wooden masks.  
	“That one right there.”  
	At the top hung a tribal mask - white, with tiny horizontal slits for eyes and mouth.  The circumfrence was ringed with a heavy green stroke, with vertical streams of blue coming from the eyes and mouth.  
	“The white one?  It looks like it weighs a ton.”  Peter hoisted it down, feeling the weight of it.  Jacob fixed it firmly to his face, and surveyed the group.  
	“Can you see?  The eye holes are tiny.”
	“Not a problem.” Jacob replied.  “It’s BEAUTIFUL.  It’s composition is nothing, it is it’s substance that speaks to me!”
	“At least it’s not a bleeding head or something.”
	Jacob moved his way to the front of store, clumsily - though to be fair, he was not graceful before the mask either.  
	“How much for this one?” he asked the man with the beard, pointing to his face.  
	“Whoa, check out Lebe.”
	“Lebe?”
	“That’s what that mask is.  He’s an African earth god.”  the man smiled, happy to share what little he knew of the topic.  “He died, or appeared to die - his bones became colored stones that took the shape of a body, but all impure things had been cast out - all that was left was pure life force.  It was through him that the Dogon people got their energy, their spirit.”
	“Lebe.” Jacob said, turning to the group.  “That’s who I am now.  Who I was becoming.”
	Paul, Rebekkah and Peter looked back, and gave a nod of approval.  
	“Lebe it is.” Peter said.  
	Lebe pulled a handful of coins and legos from his pocket.
	“That one isn't marked, is it?  Where’d you even find that?”  the man inspected the rim of the mask, finding no tag, no sign that it had ever meant to be purchased.
	“Tell you what.  It’s a lot better than those bandages.  Why don’t you just take it?”
	“Really?!”  Lebe shoved the coins back into his pocket and extended his hand.  “I don’t have much, and I don’t know how.  But I will make this up to you in some way.”
	“Don’t worry about it.  Enjoy the mask, Lebe.”
	As the quartet left the shop Lebe could feel a warm breeze funneling throught the slits in the mask, washing his face with early summer air.  He imagined the colored stones beneath his skin, where his bones used to be.  Just lying deep in there, radiating life.  
	
	“Near my house is fine again.”  Rebekkah insisted.  They had pulled up to the same anonymous curb, where the streetlights still defied Paul’s attempt to place them geographically.
	“Now, Lebe, you take care of yourself.” she said into the open window.  “Don’t get on Paul and Peter's nerves.  Call me if you need anything.”  She moved to the front row of windows.  “Peter, thanks for everything today.  You know - you’re really helping him.  You know I'd take him in if my dad didn’t-”
	“I know I know, it makes sense.” Peter surrendered.  “But we’re calling you if he get’s out of control.”
	“I’ll be there.” she insisted thankfully.  “And Paul - don’t be afraid to call me.  I called you once.  Tag.” She pushed Paul’s shoulder playfully.  Paul smiled as severely as he could, perhaps too much, and said “OK!” a little too loud.
	As Rebekkah sashayed away, Peter pushed Paul on the opposite shoulder.  “You could have showered today.”
	“We were in a hurry or I would of.”
	“Maybe you should shower when you get up in case you go somewhere instead of assuming you’re not.”
	“I have to be up and dressed by six every morning.”  Lebe interjected.  “What time do you get up?  Is there a preffered attire for breakfast?”
	“No . . no not all.”
	“What time do you leave the house?”
	“For where?”
	Lebe stared blankly at Peter in the rearview mirror.
	“We don't do anything.  Especially Paul.”
	“You came to the hospital.” Lebe said, turning to Paul.  “And the garden.”
	“Yeah, so you won’t see him again for - how long?  What would you say Paul, two weeks?  Three?”
	“Shut up.”
	“C’mon, give us a ballpark.  You gonna eat tonight?”
	Paul opened the car door as they slowed to pull into the driveway.
	“Dammit- don’t do that, it’s dangerous -”
	Pauled climbed the steps of the porch, turned his key in the door and shut it behind him.
	Lebe followed in as soon as the car as stoped, and saw no sign of Paul inside - just a dark living room hiding a dirty couch and coffee table, venetian blinds whose cords still swung slowly from being shut quickly.
	“He’s in his room.”  Peter said, fixing the deabolt and chain behind him.  “You hungry?”
	“Yeah, a little,” Lebe said, wandering inward as his eyes began to adjust.  “Will . . . will Paul not be joining us then?”
	“Nope.” Peter said, sitting down on the worn couch and flicking the TV on.  “I can tell now, when I'm not going to see him for a while.”
	“He does this a lot?”
	“Usually.”
	“Is he sick?”
	“Sort of.”
	Peter heated half a pizza that he found in the fridge, set it down in front of Lebe.  The news was completely new again - different people, different numbers.  Some things were on fire.  Some people were on stretchers.  
	“Are you worried?”  Lebe watched the TV carefully, his head bobbing from ticker-tape to story.
	“Not really.”
	“Do most things not bother you?”
	Peter shrugged, looking down the the hallway towards Paul’s room.
	“I don’t know.  You can be bothered by stuff, but you don't have to worry about it.  Those are two different things.”
	Lebe nodded.  “I’m bothered by being homeless.  But I'm not worried.”
	“Good.  You know, you’re not homeless.  You're staying here.  Sleeping in the garden, that’s homeless.”
	Lebe shook his head.  “I don’t know if that’s homeless.  ness.  There's a gazebo.”
	“I don’t think that’s a home.”
	“If you and Paul and I lived in the gazebo, would it be a home then?”
	Peter chuckled.  “This isn’t my best subject.  As long as you’re safe someplace, I’d call that home.  You’re not safe in the garden, you saw that.  You are safe here.  That's the difference.”
	Lebe took this as a sufficient answer.  He pushed his head back into the cushion of the couch.  
	“Can I sleep here?”
	“That works.  You want some blankets or something?”
	“It’s warm enough.”
	“You gonna sleep in the mask?”
	“Yes.”
	Peter moved into the hallway, listened for a moment - no sound from Paul’s bedroom, no sound from the couch.  He checked the doors to make sure they were still locked.  He grabbed the bat and made his way to his room, and soon he was all quiet as well.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>	
	It was mid afternoon when Peter entered his dark house - he stood quitely at the door for a few minutes, listening for noise.  He had opened the curtains in the morning, but they had been shut again - only thin kinves of light cut across the carpet, illuminating small slivers of couch, door, kitchen.  Slowly his eyes adjusted to reveal an empty room.  Peter sighed.  
	He set his keys on the kitchen counter, beside a half-closed box of pancake mix, and a stove top that still radiated heat.  Knew it.  The hallway was still too dark to see down, but Peter groped the wall as he made his way to Paul’s door.
	“Paul?”  Peter knocked softly on the door, then a bit louder.  “Paul, are you in there?”
	This was a rhetorical question, as there was little evidence pointing otherwise.  Still Paul remained silent.  Reluctantly Peter entered his room and crawled under his bed.
	When the house had been built - failry recently I believe - the original owner had had some plan with these rooms that was still a mystery to the two boys.  At the base of the wall the rooms shared was a small cutout, like a permanent doggie door.  When they'd been younger it had been easier to fit through; now Peter could get in to about his shoulders.  In the next room all Peter could make out was the boxspring that hovered over him, and some clothes on the floor in the distance.
	“Paul,” Peter called to the underside of his bed.  “Come talk to me.”
	The springs above his head groaned softly.
	“Not even on the last day of school, Paul?”
	“. . . No.” a voice answered softly.
	“Didn’t you want to say goodbye to - well didn’t you have to be there?”
	“No,” said the voice, muffled by more bed springs, “Half day.  We don’t do anything.”
	“Did you - go enough this year?  You were close to -”
	“Yeah, I passed.  I’ll be a senior next year.”
	“Ok well that’s good, but,” Peter turned from his stomach to his back in the cramped opening, “What about the girl?  Rebekkah?”
	“I'm not going.”
	“You said yesterday you might.”
	“Yeah, I said I might.”
	“And so you’re not?”
	“I’m not.”
	“Well that’s too bad because,” Peter groped for the shopping bag behind him, “I got you some gloves.  They look so legit.”  He half-tossed them through the opening, onto the pile of clothes beside Paul’s bed.  
	“I didn’t -”
	“I know, you just said you wouldn’t know what to do if you went, so I thought this would help.  No one’s going to know what they're doing any more than you.  Listen ok you’ll be totally, completely fine.”
	There was still no movement from above.
	“I really enjoyed talking to you last night, you know.  About Rebekkah and stuff.  You maybe want to do that again tonight?”
	“. . . You just want me to cook you food.”  There was a hint of a smile in his voice.
	“Hey, I’ll order a pizza.  Whatever.”
	Slowly a pale, slender arm descended off the side of the bed, and pulled the gloves up off the floor.  “I never should have told you her name.”
	“Or that she’s cute.”
	“That’s seriously all I know about her.”  Peter could hear Paul turning over the gloves in his hands.  “I don't want to do this.”
	“Yeah, but you should.”
	“I went to school almost every day this week.”
	“One more isn’t going to kill you.”
	“I have to be there at eight.”
	“I’ll drive you.”
	“You’re not going to wake up late are you?  Make me look stuipid?”
	“ONE TIME.”  Peter reminded him.  “And don’t lie, we had fun that day anyway.  Better than if we’d gone in, right?”
	“Yeah, yeah, maybe.  But you totally did that on purpose.”
	Peter’s neck was begining to ache from the angle it was turned at, but Paul kept talking, so Peter stayed.

            <Title>Chapter 6 - Wise and Foolish Builders</Title>
            <Synopsis>Lebe lurks around the Hollis' house, trying to understand the day to day of their lives.  Paul hardly comes out of his room.  Lebe attempts to learn more about Peter.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter 6 - Wise &amp; Foolish Builders

Lebe sat up on the couch in a start, swatting at something he could not quite picture in the fogginess of his mind.  The room had the unique feeling of being recently occupied, though whatever had been sharing the space with him in the minutes prior was gone now.
	It was morning, that much could be inferred through the light filtering in through the closed blinds and the shrill and frantic call of Acridid grasshoppers outside.  They’re known for their short antenneae and sloping forheads, and above all, their long song of courtship.  The music the males play with their spiny legs takes their female of choice through three acts - at first, the female ignores the males.  This is normal.  Then comes the second act, the passive acceptance of the male, a consolation no doubt to the self-conscious suitor but still, he keeps playing.  Finally, the third act.  Active attraction.  She sings.  At this point, females will permit copulation following brief courtship, though sometimes without it.  The latter of these grasshoppers are referred to as whores.
	One such grasshopper sat on a flower stem a few feet from the house, it’s mate playing the song Lebe had heard many times outside of his own bedroom; yet he knew this to be the only thing the two places had in common.  The sound brought him no comfort as his eyes adjusted to the dark interior of the Hollis’ living room - large, vacant, being misused as a bedroom.  
	Lebe pushed his mask back into place, which had become twisted in his sleep, and began to inspect the place. He could not feel a single person awake in the entire house, though it was nearly a quarter past six.  The carpet, which his own home had lacked, had a spongy consistency that masked his movement; still he treaded softly like a guest in a museum.
	His feet turned to sharp, sticky taps as they hit the linoleum.  It was crowded with stacks of mail and used food containers, piled upon tables and in corners, and everywhere there was the smell of the vague unsanitary.  
	Beneath one such stack of homogenous trash sat a long, rectangle wooden table, with a chair on each side.  Lebe attempted to clear himself a spot at the end by stacking several empty pizza boxes and plastic cups and moving them to the one free spot in the kitchen, the stove top.  However, when he got there the stove still radiated a slight heat, so he was forced to set the stack on the floor.  Not that this was in any way a novel concept, several more just like it lined the wall of the trash can.
	Lebe sat down at his spot, and momentarily conisdered the blank clearing of wooden tabletop before him.  He stared into the kitchen, at the cabinets and refrigerator door, before standing again and walking back to the couch.  
	Lebe retrieved his Bible from his backpack - it was a soft, worn leather edition, New American Standard Bible.  Lebe preferred the glossier language of the NIV or even, his parents fobid, King Jame’s Version - but being the oldest in his family his copy was passed down from his father, so he was more or less stuck.  Jacob had made a small compromise with his parents, that if he were to study from the sitfly worded family Bible, he’d be allowed to pick out a more visually appealing cover for it.  The cover Jacob had choosen was something like what an explorer would wrap a book in - thick canvas, lots of cargo pockets on the front holding a variety of notes and trinkets he’d collected.
	At the time his family had been finishing a three week study of Jude, and was getting dangerously close to Revelation, Lebe’s least favorite subject of the year.  Not that Lebe was particuarly fond of Jude either.  Realizing suddenly that he was no longer obligated to pick up where his family had left off, he flipped through the frail, thin paging looking for a new place to pick up.
	Why not indulge?  Lebe turned to Matthew 9:16, the first of his favorite part of the Bible - the 46 parables of Jesus.  Often less than a paragraph long, Lebe always found them to be the most galvanizing and true.  Sure, there was plenty of straight talk in the Gospels, Proverbs - but he always understood things more clearly when they were told to him in the form of a story.  Jesus understood that, which is why he told so many of them, when people were looking for a straight answer.  Jesus wasn’t much of a straight-answer kinda guy.  Neither was Lebe.  

“But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.”

Doesn’t really seem like a begining, does it?    It’s followed immediately by parable number two:

“Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”

Lebe stood and opened a row of vertical blinds that covered a sliding glass door that lead to the Hollis’ back yard.  The light was nice, warm.  Lebe thought to himself of the new things that awaited him outside.

            <Text>Jacob

 Number: 9x10^43

Jacob is a homeschooled 18 year old who is more or less experiencing life for the first time after the rapture causes his family to move back to Utah, leaving him behind.  They want to return to the grandfather�s commune where they can live and pray in peace.  Despite this conservative upbringing, however, Jacob yearns to continue the secular experience he�s begun to learn about from the rest of the quartet.  His parents give him the choice to either move back with them or strike a new life on his own, which he does, though that means moving in with Paul and Peter.  Jacob�s faith remains ambiguous yet spiritual, and while others may try to call him out on it, he reamins unoffensive and steadfast.

Jacob�s number symbolizes the minimum possibilities his life has

The day after the begining of the rapture, Fiore has a conversation with his parents.  They want to move back to Utah, etc.  Fiore wants to stay.  He packs a bag and goes out to experience the world, starting first with the garden.  After he�s accosted by the four horsemen, he is taken to a hospital where he calls Rebekkah.  The quartet goes to visit him, where he explains to them what happened.  He now has several gashes and stictches on his face.  He is shaken but still determined to live a life of his own, so he moves in with Paul and Peter.  To protect himself emotionally, Fiore buys a tribal protection mask to cover his wounds, but mostly serve as a barrier.

            <Text>Jacob becomes Lebe

Lebe, an old man, was instructed to die (or at least appear to die) and to allow himself to be buried. After Lebe did this, the seventh ancestor took the form of a snake, swallowed Lebe, and then vomited his bones. These were transformed into colored stones that fell to earth and formed the shape of a body. The pattern and arrangement of the stones helped determine the nature of social relationships, particularly marriages. After Lebe was swallowed, all that was pure and good in the ancestors went into the stones, while everything impure was cast away. The stones also symbolized the life force of the ancestors, and Lebe's death allowed this life force to be passed on to all human beings. Each year the Dogon people perform a special ritual in honor of Lebe's sacrifice.

Read more: Lebe - Myth Encyclopedia - mythology, god, snake, life, people, African http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Iz-Le/Lebe.html#ixzz1WFvBu2b1

The cult of Lebe, the Earth God, is primarily concerned with the agricultural cycle and its chief priest is called a Hogon. Each Dogon village have a Lebe shrine with an altar that have bits of earth incorporated into them to encourage the continued fertility of the land. According to Dogon beliefs, the god Lebe visits the Hogons every night in the form of a serpent and licks their skins in order to purify them and infuse them with life force. The hogons are responsible for guarding the purity of the soil and therefore officiate at many agricultural ceremonies.

            <Title>Jotham's Parable</Title>
            <Text>Jotham's Parable

The Parable

&quot;And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us. But the fig tree said unto them, Shouldhttp://open.spotify.com/track/3hQ7B0LdBp1ETFr0bvr3i5 I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us. And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us. And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.&quot;�Judges 9:7-15

The basic lesson of the parable is simple. The trees pictured Gideon and other worthy men of noble stature who felt that their calling was to serve in various capacities and not to assert rulership over their fellows. Only the lowly bramble, an unworthy scrub shrub�Abimelech�would be presumptuous enough to assume such a lofty office.

But, Jotham warns in his parable, if the bramble does become king and notes a lack of trust, he will persecute with such power as to devour the most noble of the land, pictured by the majestic cedar of Lebanon. Future events bore out the accuracy of Jotham�s predictions, for within a short while civil war broke out and continued until Abimelech was slain; a millstone was cast upon him from the top of a tower.

Reviewing the history of the past six thousand years, we note three more worthy claimants were offered this position. They, like Gideon, declined the offer, esteeming their God-given roles as being more important than rulership.

Rebekkah lives with her dad after her parent�s divorce, mainly because her mother, who makes almost no money, cannot provide a stable home for her.  Rebekkah would much rather live with her though, seeing as her split with the church has left her and her father on opposing sides of spirituality.  Her father, Walt, hopes that her living with him will �straighten her out�, and emotionally tortures her for not being �his princess� anymore.  

Not long into the rapture, Rebekkah runs away from her father, but continues to touch base with her mother while staying with Paul and Peter.  Martha, her mother, lives too far away for them to see eachother durring the course of these events.
