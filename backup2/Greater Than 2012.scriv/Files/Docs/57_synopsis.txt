Robert returns to give the first round of essay tests.  (It's been 3 days)
Paul, Peter, and Jacob are already there, having been interrupted from eating pancakes.  Paul wonders if Rebekkah is near, as he hasn't seen her in three days
As essays are being distributed, Paul picks up Rebekkah's - he seeks her out to give it to her, and ends up sitting next to her.  This backfires when both begin to detest themselves as they write their essays.
Peter's essay does not seem to be going that well either, Jacob just seems confused and asks for more paper
McGregor's essay is introduced
The quartet drive home stewing on what has just happened, feeling that maybe they will not make whatever cut is neccessary to be favored by Robert
Rebekkah is dropped off NEAR her house again, and this time feels a pang of sadness having to leave them.
McGregor returns home, and tours the church he lives in
