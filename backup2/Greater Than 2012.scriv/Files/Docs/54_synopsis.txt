Lebe begans the day confused and disoriented, unsure of how to begin his day without the daily rituals of his family.  Lebe begins by opening his Bible and consulting the 46 parables of Jesus, something that becomes a plot-driver for Lebe as the parables coincide with the arc of the rest of the story.    The first two parables are focused upon this day, where Lebe contimplates the sewing of new fabric onto old clothes, and pouring new wine into an old wineskin.  This is interpreted as Jesus sayng that as tempting as it is to add new beliefs to old ones, His word is to throw out the old and accept the new.
