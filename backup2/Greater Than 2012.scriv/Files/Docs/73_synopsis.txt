Durring this time, Lebe, Peter, and Paul, learn to to trust eachother a bit more, though they still hold a great deal back from eachother (except for Lebe, of course).  None of the core character arcs are explicitly addressed here, but many issues are backshadowed.  Paul begins to spend more time out of his room, in a manner similar to quiting smoking - it is slow, gradual, and requires defeated moments of hiding.
