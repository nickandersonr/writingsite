(orig. chapter 15) The Quartet return to the garden to find very little progress, but have a relaxing moment watering it anyway.  Paul reflects on recent writings in his notebook, and becomes nostalgic with Peter.  It helps to draw him out into the quartet a bit more.  However, their pleasant car ride is abruptly interupted when they return home to find SUMC camping out on their front lawn.
