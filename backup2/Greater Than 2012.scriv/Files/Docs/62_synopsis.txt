Rebekkah makes a surprise visit to the Hollis' residence Friday morning, with a backpack, sleeping bag, and pillow; running away from her father's house.  Peter and Jacob are caught off guard, and tell Paul.  He is hiding in his room.  He attempts to pull himself together to greet Rebekkah.  Peter and Rebekkah talk about Peter's adolescence while they hope Paul comes out.  Her presence resets him a bit, and he needs more time alone.
Neglecting to tell Rebekkah the whole truth, the rest is pointed out through exposition (ch. 19 convos should maybe take place here)
Paul finally emerges, and the four watch a sermon on TV and debate the number's meanings, all while awkwardly getting to know eachother better.
