Peter, Rebekkah, and Lebe watch a frantic news scene unfold as holy sects take over news stations, set fire to the city, and cause unrest on a global scale.  It is announced that each citezen will be provided with a garment with their number attached to it.  The group gets visitors looking for Paul, who are immediately shot by actual government agents carrying the Quartet's identification coats.  Peter attempts to deliver his coat to Paul, and ends up pushing it through the crawl space, while delivering a motivational plea for Paul to return.
