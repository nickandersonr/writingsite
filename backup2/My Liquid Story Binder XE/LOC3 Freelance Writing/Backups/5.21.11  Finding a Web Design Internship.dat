Prepare to market your work{&1310}\par \b0 There's generally three components to this - your portfolio site, resume, and business cards.  Being able to view sampes of your web design online is the most important, so lead with your site - make it your design capstone, and work the resume and cards around it.  Styles should be consistent between the mediums, and work to brand you as an all-out design machine.  Use the site to show case the 4 or so projects we talked about in step one, with the cleanest, most user-friendly interface you can create.  If you want to show off some experimental work, that’s great, but make it a subset of your site - your site should be as ‘invisible’ as possible, so that potential employers have no problem seeing your work, and then contacting you.\b {&1310}\par \b0 {&1310}\par \b 3.

If that doesn’t work, then work you way to job boards like Freelance Switch and Coroflot.
