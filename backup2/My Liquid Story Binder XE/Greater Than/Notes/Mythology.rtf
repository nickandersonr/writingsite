One that was so complex that we had to write stories to understand them, but that there came a point that we took our own stories so seriously that they lost all their meaning, and we forgot what it was like to live outside of them, what it was like to be a human being.  A human being that knows \i nothing,\i0  but that is only trying to guess to the best of their ability, and be the most decent human being possible while doing it.”
