\par “Do you think that I’m living wrong?”
\par “\i Living\i0  wrong?”
\par “Yeah like - do you ever worry that, you’re becoming someone you’re not going to be proud of?”
\par “I think that, if you look at anyone long enough you can see million things they're doing wrong.  But no one deserves that level of scrutiny.  No one could \i give \i0 you that level of scrutiny, besides yourself.  You’re the only person that can judge whether you're doing a good job of being you or not.”
