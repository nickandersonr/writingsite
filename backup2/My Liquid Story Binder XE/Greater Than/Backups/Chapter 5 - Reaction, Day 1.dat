Jacob stood silently and walked to another cabinent to retrieve a tupperware bowl.  He set it on his placemat and sat down at his place, at a large wooden table with his seven terrified siblings, all clutching their matching bowls closely in fear.  Dust particles fluttered around the room, stirred from the comotion, visible only in the tiny beams of warm morning light that came in through the slightly open windows of Jacob’s kitchen.  The house was never open, even on nice days like this, and the stagnant air only heightened the chocking atmosphere of the room.{&1310}\par \tab“Alright.  Maybe you haven’t lied to me, but you’ve left out a great deal of important details.”{&1310}\par \tab“Is this about the ice cream still?”  Jacob’s mother was more sympathetic, but was still baffled by her son’s sudden change in behavoir.  “We’ve only kept the things from you that might \i hurt\i0  you Jacob, that’s a priviledge.”{&1310}\par \tab“Our family \i is\i0  privaledged!” his father picked up.  “Do you think freedom is what you want?  What about \i safety, \i0 Jacob?  You’ve been guarded here too long to understand how \i dangerous \i0 the rest of the world is.  We are keeping you \i safe\i0 , something you wouldn’t be able to do yourself.”  Jacob opened his mouth to speak, to which his father quickly imposed, “You were \i lucky\i0  yesterday, that’s all!”  He was a thunderous, large man, his hair greyed and worn thin.  His footsteps around the table shook the silverware off of the folded cloth napkins.  Jacob held the bowl close to him so that his father couldn’t snatch it.  {&1310}\par \tab“Listen, the things you saw - the things you \i say\i0  you saw - they need to be put out of your mind.”{&1310}\par \tab“You \i still \i0 don't believe me?!” Jacob was exasperated.  “There were \i plenty \i0 of girls wearing shorts!  Soft, short, fabric shorts, the likes of which I've never seen!”  He recalled them in his memory as if they were a distant dream. “Some of them said things across the the buttocks.  Juicy.  Cheer.  Fabulous.”{&1310}\par \tab“Tell my Jacob, why would such a garment exist?  They were clearly underwear of some kind!  It was because of Angel Robert, no girl would have ever left the house like that on a day on which the world was not ending.”{&1310}\par \tab“The world isn’t ending!”  Jacob shouted back.  He could see only a sliver of sky out the window, over the vinyl fence, but he concentrated on it as he spoke.  “Not that world, out there, there’s too much life in it to die, I just couldn’t believe it.” He watched as his father’s shadow danced on the stone wall of the kitchen in the hot morning light.  “Even if it were, out there I could live three more lives today.  And three more tomorrow.  I could live a thousand more lives before the world ends.”{&1310}\par \tab“Nothing out there is real, Jacob.”  His father lowered himself into a chair, looking for once saddened.  “Your mother and I, we’ve worked hard to give you the realest, most important parts of life and spare you from the extraneous and uneccessary.  The things out there, as beautiful as they may seem now, are not important.  They will only push you further away from what is.” The man rubbed his hands over eachother, wrinked and leathery, faded from work. “Listen Jacob, we’ve made a decision as a family.  Everyone except you, that is, as you deserted us when we needed eachother the most.  While you were away we decided, the family needs to return to my father's commonality to wait for the end times.  It will be safe there.”{&1310}\par \tab“It’s safe here!” Jacob slammed his bowl onto the table, producing an unintmidating hollow resonance.{&1310}\par \tab“Listen Jacob, you know the rules.
