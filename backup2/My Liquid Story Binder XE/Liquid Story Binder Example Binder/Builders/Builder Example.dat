Each file type has its own interface and separate commands. Multiple instances of each window type can be opened simultaneously. {&1310}\par {&1310}\par Use a Planner to begin work on your novel. A Planner is a simple list that combines Chapters and notes. Begin by entering your planned chapter titles. When your list is complete, double-click any given title or note to create a corresponding Chapter. Once the title has been created, the item will then appear bold white, notes remaining indented grey. Use the Planner to create further Chapters and open existing titles.

The Lusitania had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible speed.  The women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn.  Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children closely to their breasts.  One girl stood alone, slightly apart from the rest.  She was quite young, not more than eighteen.  She did not seem afraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead.{&1310}\par {&1310}\par "I beg your pardon."{&1310}\par {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf1\fs16 ..Line Notes Play an Important Role in Liquid Story Binder XE\cf2\fs22 {&1310}\par \pard\li720\sl0\slmult1 {&1310}\par \pard\sl0\slmult1\cf1\fs16 ..Any paragraph beginning with two periods is designated as a line note.
