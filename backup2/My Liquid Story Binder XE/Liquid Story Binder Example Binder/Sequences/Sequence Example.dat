Sherlock Holmes¶Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in publication in 1887.  He was devised by Scottish author and doctor Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  A brilliant London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his prowess at using logic and astute observation to solve cases.  He is perhaps the most famous fictional detective, and indeed one of the best known and most universally recognisable literary characters.¶Images\Example Image 2.gif¶
Doctor Watson¶Though Watson plays a part in the case, he is primarily significant as the narrator of the story.  Since he is, like most readers, not a detective, he is able to relate information as the average person would likely see it.  This is beneficial because it keeps the novel suspenseful, much more so than if we knew that Holmes suspected the Stapletons from the start.{&1310}¶Images\Example Image 3.gif¶
