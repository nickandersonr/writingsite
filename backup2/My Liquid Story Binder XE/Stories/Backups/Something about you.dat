Its not so much that you light up the room when I see you, that I hear music, all the cliches - it’s that seeing you, is less like a path I never finished and more a tangled mess of yarn that I remember having my fingers deep in, searching for the frayed end, pulling out only loop after loop.  {&1310}\par Xanax doesn’t have the same affect on me as it used to; and neither does your smile.  They're drugs I don’t need anymore, but that I still find comfort in from time to time.  Occasionallythey work.  Last night they didn’t.  I still picked you out in the crowd of people, instantaneous.  But I didn’t want a hug or a kiss; even after swiping the second piture of beer from our neighbor's table the lust of theft I felt flatlined and my commrade, my accomplice, your glass has always been full.  It never stopped me from pouring.  I placed it back when no one was looking.  No ammount of pleasantries cound flint another fire, no gentle fanning can nurse warmth from the blackened powder I still caress cuiriously across the surface of my comforter, remembering the shape that layed below it.  I still wonder what form would be left if we’d burnt a cooler flame.  I promised you Olympic torches, but I gave you dead campfire pits, filled with empty beer cans and five hour logs that burnt bright green fireworks until the wrappings were gone from around the cold dead brick inside.  They never light again once you burn through that.  And the nights get cold and I’m sorry for all the metaphors, I think if I really understood what happened I could just tell you but these things still make little sense to me.  So campfires, so yarn.  Something.  {&1310}\par {&1310}\par I meant it, when I said I wanted to be friends.  I guess I can say that, no comparison needed.  But intent and possibility have alway been at odds, in me at least, so all you get are ashes.{&1310}\par }{&1310}
