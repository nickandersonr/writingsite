She asked me to write her a story about a female spy that drops an explosive pen that gets picked up by man, exploding in his hand.  This is that story.{&1310}\fs20   {&1310}\i0\b\fs26 \{&1310}\{&1310}{&1310}\b0 {&09}My dad always told me that everything a woman does is for attention.  He was a bad person, let\'92s not even get into that.  I never believed it, but I\'92ll tell you, the week I\'92ve had makes me think different.  \{&1310}{&09}So I was at the station on Wednesday morning, just like always, when this gorgeous women stepped off the platform - tall, with dark, dark brown hair.  She had this little smirk hidden by the brim of her green hat, I could just tell she was some sort of trouble.  She was wearing one of the loudest green dresses I\'92ve ever seen, such a slender fit on those curves and - I understand, I\'92m sounding like my dad again, I\'92m just trying to make a point - I should have known she was going to be trouble.  When she passed by me the breeze she left was subtle - not like some perfumed school girl sending it out in all directions, no, her scent was thin, meant for people who were standing close to her.  Something about that drove me wild, the intimacy of it all.  Now, I\'92m an old man -  I don\'92t {&1310}\i expect{&1310}\i0  a girl like that to pay me any mind and I\'92d be some kind of pervert if I did.  But the look she gave me, turning her head back a bit to smile though she was already a few feet passed - it just melted my heart.  Its been {&1310}\i years{&1310}\i0  since someone gave me a second glance like that, and there\'92s no harm in liking it.  \{&1310}{&09}But that\'92s when I get this idea - she\'92s not doing that for me.  She\'92s doing it for her.  What intention could she possibly have with an old dustrag like myself?  I realized the insincerity right there, as she swept that smile across the hordes of men lining the station, I realized what I had failed to see as a young man when I thought that surely those smiles were for me.  \{&1310}{&09}So then this girl, plastering that alluring smile all over the walls of the place, as she\'92s walking and so transfixed on that, she loosens her grip on her hand bag and this pen slides through onto the ground.   \{&1310}{&09}\'91That was on purpose\'92 I think immediately, as she trots on.  She\'92s waiting for us all to jump on it, bloody some noses over who gets to hand the pen back to her.\{&1310}\{&1310}{&09}Maybe I\'92m just bitter since Helen passed.  I always thought she was the sanest of all of them, that no matter whatever the rest of her gender had done to me, she had come in at the last second to show that there was method to the madness.  But now that she\'92s left its hard to see that, its more believable by far that my mind has simply exaggerated her in the years since her passing and that no one was ever that good to begin with.  Maybe that\'92s why I didn\'92t want to pick up the pen, which rolled to just inches in front of my feet.  \'91She\'92s just doing it for the attention\'92  I thought again as she paused, confused, grasping at her purse like she knew something was wrong.  \{&1310}{&09}Helen would want me to pick it up.  She had always hated my dad.  \'91He\'92s a cynic and a broken man,\'92 she would tell me, though it was hard for me to believe.  The man had raised me and had been right in most other respects.  Its difficult to take some parts of a person and discredit the rest.  \{&1310}{&09}So I pick it up.  Helen had always been right, had always known the simple answers to questions like this, that I could spend all morning debating.  The simple answer for this one?  You return the pen.  Of course you do.  But as I\'92m holding this pen, the woman\'92s face contorting into something more than a smirk, I see these tiny lights on it and the lights become brighter, and I can feel my hand just consumed in the most dramatic heat imaginable.  The explosion was so loud and so close that I just heard an instant of it before my ears began ringing, cutting off all the sound completely, and then the heat was everywhere and I couldn\'92t see anything.\{&1310}{&09}Just goes to show ya - right when you\'92re ready to put you\'92re faith back in something, there\'92s someone waiting to make a fool out of you for doing it.  Maybe I\'92m just bitter since Helen\'92s passed.  I\'92m not sure what\'92s happening now - seems to be a big fuss - but I\'92ve already mentioned her and I think they know what I\'92m talking about.  I think I know too, slowly, though I don\'92t want to admit, but I know this isn\'92t the train station, I\'92m not in south Houston, but that\'92s fine, I\'92m playing it by ear.  I\'92ve been thinking about Helen again.  I don\'92t think I did exaggerate her, now that I\'92ve thought about it, I really think she did show them all up, because that\'92s just the way she is.  If I do see her, this will surely be the first thing I tell her.}{&1310}
