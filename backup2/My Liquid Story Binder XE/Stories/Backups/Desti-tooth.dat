As I pulled the slick thread between a couple of molars he exited, making a tiny door out of what had appeared to me to be solid enamel.  He was a short, stout man in a dressy fedora, looking a bit preoccupied as he stepped out onto my bottom lip.  I ceased flossing, fearing the motion would shake him to certain death in the ceramic sink, and observed as he looked left and right, walked to the other side of my front row of teeth, before turning silently and looking straightforward at himself in the mirror.  He lifted the sagging jowls around his face, pulled at the bags under his eyes.  For a moment it looked like he was about to cry, but instead he again sighed, turned, and reentered my tooth, pulling shut the tiny white door.  \{&1310}{&09}He did not come out much.  Mainly it was after I brushed, which I\'92m sure was just to see what all the hubbub was about.  I always made sure that his door was shut all the way before I  began.  Every few nights he would emerge and perform the same basic routine, wandering complacently to the other side of my mouth, before returning to his own abode.  \{&1310}{&09}Gradually he started making appearances during meals.  I would feel the tiny door open mid chew, and would pause for the man to inspect the world outside in peace, from his perch on my bottom lip.  This began to worry my friends.  While they initially expressed interest at the little gentleman taking shelter in my incisor, eventually his intrusion into our conversations became difficult; stories were hung mid sentence while he walked across my lip, and scanned the sky for sometimes ten or twenty minutes at a time.  As fall set in, he began to sit and take in the cooling air.  He fidgeted with his hands, spoke words half out loud to some unseen companion, then shook his head and returned to his home.  \{&1310}{&09}\'93Leave him somewhere,\'94 one of my friends suggested.  \'93If he can live in your tooth, he can live anywhere.\'94  \{&1310}{&09}\'93It\'92s his home, though.\'94 I contested.  The man felt like a part of me.  I felt a certain kind of responsibility.  \{&1310}{&09}So he appeared in pictures with my friends, even in my photo ID tag.  He met my family over the holidays, though he simply stared at them, unaware, perhaps unable to make sense out of their large, distant shapes.  He impressed drunks at bars and made for interesting first date conversation.\{&1310}{&09}Then one night in January, I heard small sobs coming from my left canine tooth.  I got up and went to the bathroom to see what was the matter - there the man sat on my lip in the quiet night air, his face in his hands.  \{&1310}{&09}\'93What\'92s wrong?\'94 I asked, though my words nearly rocketed him from my lips.  He looked up at me, his eyes stained red with wear.  He got up and walked to my right canine, and opened a door just like that on his own tooth.  The inside was empty.  He looked up at me and pointed inside.  Sitting down again by the open door, he sniffled and shrugged, began to chuckle a little and shook his head.  He talked very quietly to himself for a moment, his words muted and unclear.  Finally he wiped his eyes, and standing, shut the door to my right canine.  He then proceeded to his door and did the same.  Smiling a tired grin he looked up at me, pointed to the warm water knob of the sink and nodded.  I nodded back, and started the water, which created a shallow pool as the drain fought to keep up with the faucet.  The man from my tooth cautiously made his way to the edge of my lip, and pushing his hat firmly onto his head, elegantly swan dived into the sink, disappearing down the drain.  I let the water run for a few minutes, just to make sure.\{&1310}{&09}When I eat now, I have no unexpected visitors; my socializing runs steadily without interruption.  My friends asked about him at first, but things have more or less returned to normal.  Still, its hard to brush my teeth without thinking about him.  I listen to the murmur of the bathroom sink swallowing water.  Wherever you are now sir, it was a pleasure.  }{&1310}
