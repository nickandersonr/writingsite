It&#8217;s rated really high in the Ideas forum!&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what I think, all the decisions get made by an elite crime-fighting squad funded by an anonymous millionaire. Er, I mean the four core devs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>These sentiments, and others like them, are the focus of today&#8217;s post. Setting aside the similarities between Ryan, Andrew, Mark and Peter to Charlie&#8217;s Angels for a moment, the question of how decisions about features are made needs to be addressed. There are a number of mechanisms in place for communication between the community and the core team, but with so many different channels, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with them all and still focus on production. Here&#8217;s where we are now&#8230;</p>\\n<p><strong>#wordpress-dev IRC channel</strong>: The IRC channel used to be more active. These days there&#8217;s rarely more than a dozen or two people online at any given time, and hours go by with no activity. When a question pops up, it&#8217;s often a tech question from a less experienced developer or site manager looking for help, as opposed to ongoing discussions about the best way to approach core code and features. When core-focused discussions do occur, they tend to fade out as time zone variances cause people to log off before a core dev enters the room.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/">wp-hackers list</a>:</strong> The hackers mailing list reaches thousands of contributing developers, plugin developers, and lurking interested parties. Discussions range from how to use hooks to whether or not something in core should be changed to troubleshooting for other list members. Conversations on this list sometimes can get heated and occasionally stray into rudeness, which makes some people hesitate to utilize this communication channel.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/development">This dev blog</a>:</strong> This blog is used mostly for &#8220;official&#8221; announcements, and more recently, for surveys and polls intended to give the core devs an idea of community opinion on things being considered for future versions. Posting is irregular, sometimes with new content every other day, sometimes with nothing for a couple of weeks.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/">wpdevel.wordpress.com</a>:</strong> Another blog, also an &#8220;official&#8221; outlet, in which the core team posts about any big code changes they&#8217;re working on. This gives plugin authors and contributing developers a heads-up, and provides a place for community discussion around specific issues like the new widgets API.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org">Trac</a>: </strong>The ticket system used for active development has gotten out of control. Hundreds of tickets are already lined up for future versions because they were punted from current releases; many aren&#8217;t even relevant anymore. Trac has wound being a place where people report bugs, suggest code changes, request features and debate methodologies; some of these conversations are years old. This broad use of the system makes it harder to power through tickets and get bugs fixed.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">Ideas forum</a>:</strong> The Ideas forum is a place where anyone can suggest a new feature, rate features suggested by others, leave comments, and generally discuss the future of the WordPress application.

Er, I mean the four core devs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>These sentiments, and others like them, are the focus of today&#8217;s post. Setting aside the similarities between Ryan, Andrew, Mark and Peter to Charlie&#8217;s Angels for a moment, the question of how decisions about features are made needs to be addressed. There are a number of mechanisms in place for communication between the community and the core team, but with so many different channels, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with them all and still focus on production. Here&#8217;s where we are now&#8230;</p>\\n<p><strong>#wordpress-dev IRC channel</strong>: The IRC channel used to be more active. These days there&#8217;s rarely more than a dozen or two people online at any given time, and hours go by with no activity. When a question pops up, it&#8217;s often a tech question from a less experienced developer or site manager looking for help, as opposed to ongoing discussions about the best way to approach core code and features. When core-focused discussions do occur, they tend to fade out as time zone variances cause people to log off before a core dev enters the room.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/">wp-hackers list</a>:</strong> The hackers mailing list reaches thousands of contributing developers, plugin developers, and lurking interested parties. Discussions range from how to use hooks to whether or not something in core should be changed to troubleshooting for other list members. Conversations on this list sometimes can get heated and occasionally stray into rudeness, which makes some people hesitate to utilize this communication channel.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/development">This dev blog</a>:</strong> This blog is used mostly for &#8220;official&#8221; announcements, and more recently, for surveys and polls intended to give the core devs an idea of community opinion on things being considered for future versions. Posting is irregular, sometimes with new content every other day, sometimes with nothing for a couple of weeks.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/">wpdevel.wordpress.com</a>:</strong> Another blog, also an &#8220;official&#8221; outlet, in which the core team posts about any big code changes they&#8217;re working on. This gives plugin authors and contributing developers a heads-up, and provides a place for community discussion around specific issues like the new widgets API.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org">Trac</a>: </strong>The ticket system used for active development has gotten out of control. Hundreds of tickets are already lined up for future versions because they were punted from current releases; many aren&#8217;t even relevant anymore. Trac has wound being a place where people report bugs, suggest code changes, request features and debate methodologies; some of these conversations are years old. This broad use of the system makes it harder to power through tickets and get bugs fixed.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">Ideas forum</a>:</strong> The Ideas forum is a place where anyone can suggest a new feature, rate features suggested by others, leave comments, and generally discuss the future of the WordPress application. However, like Trac, some of the items here are years old. Because of the way the rating system works, older items remain at the top of the list. Some threads are simply he said/she said preference arguments, as opposed to contructive discussions about the value of implementing certain features or changes. There&#8217;s no direct connection between the Ideas forum and Trac.</p>\\n<p>WordPress is an open source project, successful because of the community that both develops and uses it.

First, determine the scope of your test and create a test protocol/script. Determine the audience segments to be included in the test group(s), and begin recruiting. Recruiting may mean hiring an agency to find participants, but for testing WordPress, it makes more sense to recruit from within this community, so that means making a screening survey, reading all the responses, segmenting the respondents into categories and contacting people until you&#8217;ve filled your desired quotas (for whatever segments you&#8217;re seeking, such as newbie, experienced user, developer, CMS user, photoblogger, mobile user, etc. ).

When the sessions are complete, the results are analyzed. All the notes and videos are reviewed, patterns are identified, and ultimately a report is written and the feedback informs the next round of revisions.</p>\\n<p>Some people think it shouldn&#8217;t take much time to do all this. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of people who cite <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html">an old article by Jakob Nielsen</a> that says you don&#8217;t need to test with more than 5 users because usability issues become clear right away. While I&#8217;ve found that to be generally true, when your user base is as diverse in experience level, usage, platform  configuration, language (right to left languages have a pretty different experience) and demography as the WordPress community is, 5 users really isn&#8217;t enough to get a clear picture.

We&#8217;ll be looking for volunteer moderators as well as participants, hopefully from all over the world.</p>\\n<p><strong>Moderators.</strong> Observational usability testing isn&#8217;t rocket science, but neither is it a simple task to reduce bias. Because of this, at first we&#8217;ll choose only moderators who have professional experience conducting usability tests. People who conduct testing for design agencies, software companies, usability consulting firms and the like will be our first round draft picks. In the future, when we have a group of regular volunteers and have ironed out any kinks in the process, we&#8217;ll ideally match up experienced testers with aspiring ones, using a mentorship model to increase the number of people who can contribute in this fashion.</p>\\n<p><strong>Participants.</strong> If you use WordPress, chances are you could participant in a usability test at some point. In some cases we&#8217;re looking for particular behaviors (people who upload large video files, people who blog from their iPhone, people who manage more than 5 blogs, etc.), while other times the behaviors we&#8217;re looking for are much more common (do you have widgets in your sidebar, have you changed themes in the last 6 months, is there more than one author on your blog, etc.).</p>\\n<p><strong>So how will these opportunities come into play, and how will it make WordPress better?</strong></p>\\n<p>We&#8217;ll start with the moderators, and try to get volunteers with a decent geographic spread.

The idea behind it was to see what would happen to the web if it was as easy for anyone to create a social network as it is to create a blog today. There&#8217;s been an explosion of social activity on the web, it&#8217;s probably the most important trend of the past few years, but there&#8217;s been a dearth of Open Source tools that enable the social web.</p>\\n<p>In WordPress we have a robust and extensible base that can scale to many millions of users, and BuddyPress is essentially a set of plugins on top of WordPress that add private messaging, profiles, friends, groups, activity streams, and everything else you&#8217;ve come to expect from your favorite social network, like a Facebook-in-a-box.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t think BuddyPress will be something you use <em>instead of</em> your existing social networks, I mean all your friends are already on Myspace, but if you wanted to start something new maybe with more control, friendlier terms of service, or just something customized and tweaked to fit exactly into your existing site, then BuddyPress is a great framework to use. Maybe even someday you&#8217;ll be able to connect your BuddyPresses to each other and to the existing monolithic social networks.</p>\\n<p>This is just a 1.0 release and it&#8217;s not for everybody yet, for example it currently requires using MU which is a bit trickier to get set up than regular WordPress, but regardless <a href="http://buddypress.org/">I&#8217;d recommend diving into the community at BuddyPress.org</a>, which is great example of the software in action.</p>\\n<p><a href="http://buddypress.org/blog/news/buddypress-10-has-arrived/">Here&#8217;s Andy&#8217;s official announcement post</a>.</p>\\n";\}s:3:"wfw";a:1:\{s:10:"commentrss";s:75:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/04/make-friends-with-buddypress/feed/";\}s:5:"slash";a:1:\{s:8:"comments";s:2:"49";\}s:7:"summary";s:329:"What if there was software with the elegance and extensibility of WordPress but all the features you&#8217;ve come to expect from social networks like Facebook?

There&#8217;s been an explosion of social activity on the web, it&#8217;s probably the most important trend of the past few years, but there&#8217;s been a dearth of Open Source tools that enable the social web.</p>\\n<p>In WordPress we have a robust and extensible base that can scale to many millions of users, and BuddyPress is essentially a set of plugins on top of WordPress that add private messaging, profiles, friends, groups, activity streams, and everything else you&#8217;ve come to expect from your favorite social network, like a Facebook-in-a-box.</p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t think BuddyPress will be something you use <em>instead of</em> your existing social networks, I mean all your friends are already on Myspace, but if you wanted to start something new maybe with more control, friendlier terms of service, or just something customized and tweaked to fit exactly into your existing site, then BuddyPress is a great framework to use. Maybe even someday you&#8217;ll be able to connect your BuddyPresses to each other and to the existing monolithic social networks.</p>\\n<p>This is just a 1.0 release and it&#8217;s not for everybody yet, for example it currently requires using MU which is a bit trickier to get set up than regular WordPress, but regardless <a href="http://buddypress.org/">I&#8217;d recommend diving into the community at BuddyPress.org</a>, which is great example of the software in action.</p>\\n<p><a href="http://buddypress.org/blog/news/buddypress-10-has-arrived/">Here&#8217;s Andy&#8217;s official announcement post</a>.</p>\\n";\}i:9;a:13:\{s:5:"title";s:26:"Design Tweaks Poll Results";s:4:"link";s:54:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/04/poll-results/";s:8:"comments";s:63:"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/04/poll-results/#comments";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 30 Apr 2009 15:19:02 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:\{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Jane Wells";\}s:8:"category";s:14:"User Interface";s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=701";s:11:"description";s:357:"The poll is closed, the votes are counted, and the results are interesting.

What was most interesting for me was checking in on the votes over the course of the two days the poll was open. The top three (Fluency-dark, Current 2.7, MT) kept beating each other out for the #1 spot as they cycled back and forth through the top three slots, and had the poll closed on time (left it open a little longer in case anyone translated the time zone incorrectly), the order would have been a bit different.</p>\\n<p>What&#8217;s more interesting to me is the overall style that seems to be preferred among voters, as Matt&#8217;s comp has some stylistic similarities to Dean&#8217;s (see image at left).

Then again, so do the designs of Matt Thomas (he&#8217;s behind the current style of 2.7, remember, in addition to the comp labeled MT). To give the interface the attention it is due, and to take seriously some of the interface feedback around usability and accessibility, we&#8217;re going to leave the looks alone for 2.8. It&#8217;s our guess that a revised style will make into 2.9 early in the development cycle to allow us plenty of time for user testing and revision.

of my friends recently asked me a question whether using too many plugins made any difference on how his blog worked and performed, I thought it best to give that answer to a broader audience, so here goes.</p>\\n<h3>Does It Matter If You Use 1 or 100s of Plugins?</h3>\\n<p>The answer is yes, it does matter, each and every plugin you use has to be processed before an actual page is generated, so all the plugin files are compiled in order to get the intended output.</p>\\n<p>This may in the end not actually make a big difference in your blogs load time, however it may eventually slow it down a little bit.</p>\\n<h3>Do Plugins Add Overhead To Your Site?</h3>\\n<p>Yes at times they do add overhead to your site, for example quite recently I was using a plugin that added 180Kbs of JavaScript code to each and every page on the site, however that plugins functionality was only useful on a single page.</p>\\n<p>You should periodically check these things out as you may be unnecessarily increasing your page load times, if possible try and find an alternative or contact the plugin author to add an option to limit overheads to only those pages where the plugin functions.</p>\\n<h3>Should I Stop Using Too Many Plugins Then?</h3>\\n<p>Not exactly, like I said it does affect your blog load times and you might want to take a look at your plugins to see which of them are really useful and maybe remove some of them.</p>\\n<p>I usually change several things on the site quite often, and with that I stop using the functionality provided by certain plugins. I run a weekly or bi-weekly maintenance or spring cleaning of the blog, in which I take a look at all the active plugins and see whether I am using them or not, and disable those that I no longer use.</p>\\n<p>Many a times you will find that there are plugins that are unused and are still active, it is best to disable those plugins while you are not using them and enable them back whenever you need to use their functionality.</p>\\n<h3>What Type Of Plugins Should I Avoid?</h3>\\n<p>There is no real rule-of-thumb for me to say what to avoid and what to use, each plugin\'92s functionality is different and useful, however something that is useful to me may not be useful to someone else and vice versa.</p>\\n<p>However as a general rule, on a high traffic blog try and avoid plugins that make many database calls, since it may affect performance, it is ok to make around 10-20 queries per page, however anything more than that degrades performance and <em>may</em> crash the DB on high traffic sites.</p>\\n<h3>What Else? Tell Us Your Tips</h3>\\n<p>There may be several other things you might want to add, go ahead and tell us what you think should be ideal when it comes to using plugins, we would love to hear your opinions.</p>\\n<p>Also, I will be doing a follow up post addressing several things that have been left unanswered in this post, if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment, I will try and answer them in the follow up post.</p>\\n<p>Post from: <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com">Weblog Tools Collection</a></p>\\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/06/19/wordpress-plugins-usage-faqs/">Does It Matter If I Use 1 Plugin Or 100s Of Them?</a></p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sat, 20 Jun 2009 01:40:45 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:\{s:7:"creator";s:12:"Keith Dsouza";\}s:7:"summary";s:3241:"<p>One of my friends recently asked me a question whether using too many plugins made any difference on how his blog worked and performed, I thought it best to give that answer to a broader audience, so here goes.</p>\\n<h3>Does It Matter If You Use 1 or 100s of Plugins?</h3>\\n<p>The answer is yes, it does matter, each and every plugin you use has to be processed before an actual page is generated, so all the plugin files are compiled in order to get the intended output.</p>\\n<p>This may in the end not actually make a big difference in your blogs load time, however it may eventually slow it down a little bit.</p>\\n<h3>Do Plugins Add Overhead To Your Site?</h3>\\n<p>Yes at times they do add overhead to your site, for example quite recently I was using a plugin that added 180Kbs of JavaScript code to each and every page on the site, however that plugins functionality was only useful on a single page.</p>\\n<p>You should periodically check these things out as you may be unnecessarily increasing your page load times, if possible try and find an alternative or contact the plugin author to add an option to limit overheads to only those pages where the plugin functions.</p>\\n<h3>Should I Stop Using Too Many Plugins Then?</h3>\\n<p>Not exactly, like I said it does affect your blog load times and you might want to take a look at your plugins to see which of them are really useful and maybe remove some of them.</p>\\n<p>I usually change several things on the site quite often, and with that I stop using the functionality provided by certain plugins.

All <abbr title="The Way I Work">TWIW</abbr> articles are written in the first person, but not directly authored by the subjects, and we\'92re not allowed to see them before they&#8217;re published. These bizarre rules have some unexpected outcomes, and I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of rewriting the article in my own words and with lots of extra links. (<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090601/the-way-i-work-matt-mullenweg.html">You can read the original here</a>.)</em></p>\\n<p>On a good morning there&#8217;s no alarm clock. I wake up with the sun and do my best to resist the instinctive urge to look at the computer or check email for at least an hour.</p>\\n<p>My vice of choice isn&#8217;t coffee, but <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/03/hoi-an/mcm_2095/">the Kindle</a>. Its electronic shelves are filled mostly with the business books  I read in order to grow up to be a <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/06/23/this-is-serious-business/">real businessman</a> (before someone figures out I&#8217;m not). At any point in time I have about 120 books downloaded. Interspersed between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Drucker</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Godin</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life/dp/0553805096">Buffett</a> are classics <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/04/24/on-the-shortness-of-life-an-introduction-to-seneca">like Seneca</a>, which I wish I could read more often but only get to a few times a year.</p>\\n<p><a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the holding company behind <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, finally got an office late last year at Pier 38, a <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/03/wordpress-party-pictures/mcm_4054-3/">beautiful open-floorplan space</a> right <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/3400378403/">on the Embarcadero</a>. It\'92s about a five-minute walk from my apartment, but my preference is to work from home. We&#8217;re very much a virtual company where everyone primarily works from home (or their coffee shop of choice). The half dozen of us in the Bay Area will go in on Thursdays to have a little company, but six days out of the week the space is usually empty. <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/03/wordpress-party-pictures/">But we throw some great parties there</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href="http://ma.tt/2009/05/how-p2-changed-automattic/">The team communicates mostly via P2</a>, something a little like Twitter but password-protected, with real-time updates and threaded inline conversations. P2 is almost like a chat channel, but structured like a blog, and we&#8217;ve evolved to have almost a dozen across the 40 people at Automattic \'96 serving a variety of purposes. We fill any gaps in communication by IRC, Skype, and, in a pinch, <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/">email</a>.</p>\\n<p>In my home office there are two 30-inch monitors &#8212; a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac</a> and a PC. They share the same mouse and keyboard <a href="http://ma.tt/feed/synergy2.sourceforge.net">using Synergy</a> so I can copy and paste between them. The Mac is mostly used for email and <a href="http://adium.im/">chat</a>, while web stuff and coding happen on the PC. <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/">The keyboard is, of course, Dvorak</a>, a more efficient keyboard layout that I switched to 10 years ago. I also have a<a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-16668-Sony+Vaio+Z+Series+(Z90)+Unboxing.html"> Sony Z90 laptop</a> with me all the time, whether I&#8217;m going overseas or just to the doctor&#8217;s office. I&#8217;m pretty rough on laptops, sometimes going through two a year. At home I like to <a href="http://www.qnap.com/">geek out with home servers</a> and networking, and sometimes find myself doing IT support for family, friends, and colleagues.</p>\\n<p>One of my favorite programs that we didn&#8217;t make is <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>. Hackers all know that you have to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProfileBeforeOptimizing">profile before you can optimize</a>, and RescueTime runs in the trap of my computers and tracks how much time I spend on different things, sometimes with surprising results. My biggest time-suck is email, and to help out I wrote a WordPress plugin that filters people into folders based on their email address and priority settings which helps keep my inbox relatively clean. <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Ferriss, author of The 4-Hour Work Week</a>, advocates checking email only twice a week but that&#8217;s too severe for me. I&#8217;m currently trying <a href="http://thepowerofless.com/">Leo Babauta&#8217;s approach from The Power of Less</a>, which suggests small steps like checking email five set times a day instead of constantly. It&#8217;s like dieting: People who binge diet gain it all back. That happens to me with email.</p>\\n<p>Music is my muse and I listen to it all day. There&#8217;s a lot of jazz &#8212; Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins &#8212; but I\'92m also a big fan of Jay-Z, Beyonc\'e9, and Method Man. I have an analog <a href="http://www.shindo-laboratory.co.jp">Shindo stereo</a> that was hand built in Japan and the aural experience is mind-blowing. When you&#8217;re coding you really have to be in the zone so I&#8217;ll listen to a single song over and over on repeat, hundreds of times. It helps me focus. The other best way to <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">focus</a> is to turn off email and instant messenger. The moment that little toaster pops up and says &#8220;you&#8217;ve got mail&#8221; you&#8217;re taken out of the flow. You&#8217;re juggling variables and functions and layouts and the moment you look away it all falls to the ground &#8212; <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html">it takes you 10 minutes getting it back in the air again</a>.</p>\\n<p>A big part of my job is to manage the support, usability, and product development people who are scattered all over the globe, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113869743175067729104.00000112d8fd60502d894&amp;ll=13.239945,-52.734375&amp;spn=166.689576,360&amp;z=1&amp;om=1">from Alabama to Ireland to Bulgaria</a>. My management strategy is <a href="http://automattic.com/jobs/">centered on hiring</a>: find extremely self-motivated and curious people and then give them the autonomy to succeed. There&#8217;s no manager looking over anybody&#8217;s shoulder, so everyone needs to be self-directed. For every person we hire there are hundreds of applications. We always start people on a contract basis first; <a href="http://automattic.com/about/how-we-work/">that way we mutually understand what it&#8217;s like to work with each other</a>. One of the most important things I look for in r\'e9sum\'e9s is a history of contributing to <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source projects</a>, because I know these people will understand our ethos.</p>\\n<p>For four years I was the only developer on <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet, our anti-spam service</a>. It started because my mom had wanted to start a blog but I was scared she&#8217;d be bombarded by spam for Viagra and worse, think that&#8217;s what I looked at all day. We finally added a second engineer to the project at the end of 2008, which was weird for me but was necessary for growth, especially as I&#8217;m pulled in more and more directions.</p>\\n<p>I go out for lunch whenever I can, which fits well with my preference for no meetings before 11 AM. There&#8217;s something very personal about sharing food with someone; it&#8217;s a deeper connection than shaking hands in a boardroom. Often when I&#8217;m in town I&#8217;ll have lunch with <a href="http://toni.org/">Toni Schneider, my CEO</a>. He and I get along super well which is one of the reasons I think the business has worked. He brings gravitas because he&#8217;s a digital native but also has great startup experience including being the CEO of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddpost">Oddpost</a>, a webmail company <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo-acquires-Oddpost-to-bolster-e-mail/2100-1038_3-5266019.html">Yahoo acquired in 2004</a>. Sometimes we&#8217;ll go to lunch at 12:30 and stay until 5.</p>\\n<p>In general, I&#8217;m pretty darn disorganized, late as often as not, and really bad at keeping a schedule. My PA is now focusing on office and event tasks so I&#8217;m in the market for someone new. <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/photomatt">Last year I was on the road 212 days and clocked 175,000 miles</a>, which is seven times around the globe (according to Dopplr, a great travel journal I use). The bulk of my travel is to <a href="http://wordcamp.org/">WordCamps, which are educational and networking events that celebrate blogging</a>. Automattic held our first annual WordCamp in San Francisco in 2006, thrown together just a few weeks before the event happened. Now they&#8217;ve exploded all over the world and I&#8217;ve been to over 30 community-organized events from <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/08/wordcamp-south-africa-photos/">South Africa</a> to the Philippines. I say they&#8217;re a great bargain: a full day of quality speakers, BBQ lunch, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/naokomc/3604736422/">a cool t-shirt</a>, and a party for $25. We just wrapped the <a href="http://2009.sf.wordcamp.org/">largest WordCamp ever</a> here in San Francisco with over 700 people.  Though I\'92d love to, if I went to every WordCamp I wouldn&#8217;t have any time to actually build WordPress, so I&#8217;m cutting back and trying to go to every other one. They are great fun, though; it&#8217;s a chance to be a rockstar for a day. In the Philippines after the conference was done I stayed almost two hours afterward taking pictures and autographing badges and laptops. I&#8217;ve even been asked to sign body parts. Really.</p>\\n<p>To document my experiences when I travel I use my Nikon D3 camera. <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">My photos are autobiographical</a> &#8212; my memory is so bad (and the travel pretty grueling) that I&#8217;ll forget everything about a trip, and the photos help trigger my memories. On the plane ride home I&#8217;ll process and edit the photos as a narrative of each day, a visual diary. On my <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/?s=vietnam">trip to Vietnam last February I took 2-3 thousand photos</a>. I\'92ve heard that the difference between an amateur photographer and a pro is that the amateur shows you everything they shoot. I&#8217;m somewhere in between &#8212; I&#8217;ll post maybe a quarter of what I take.</p>\\n<p>I used to think constantly about building an audience for my blog but now my attitude is that if I&#8217;m not blogging for myself it&#8217;s not worth it. I don&#8217;t force myself to post once a day, I just do it when it feels natural. Sometimes people complain &#8212; &#8220;Write more about WordPress; we don&#8217;t want to see photos of kids in Vietnam&#8221; &#8212; but I don\'92t really care. For my 25th birthday in January I published a list of 2009 goals on my blog. It included learning Spanish, learning how to cook, and posting 10,000 photos. Cooking has been a total fail so far; I go out for every meal. If you open my refrigerator you&#8217;ll find Girl Scout cookies and barbecue sauce. Photos are blazing along, half-way through the year and I&#8217;ve taken 20,000 photos and posted about 4,000 of them.</p>\\n<p>My blog is fortunate enough to get lot of comments and I read and manually approve each one. I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows">broken windows theory</a> &#8212; a broken window or graffiti in a neighborhood begets more of the same &#8212; applies online. I&#8217;ll happily approve a comment from someone who completely disagrees with everything I believe in, but if I get a positive comment with a curse word in it I&#8217;ll edit it out. My blog is like my living room: If someone was acting out in my house, I&#8217;d ask that person to leave.<br />\\nI look at our numbers every day, usually after 5 PM PST when GMT goes into a new day. We have an internal dashboard where we track 500 to 600 statistics about everything from how often people are logging in to WordPress.com to how many words they&#8217;re pressing per day. Almost all of the numbers are real-time.</p>\\n<p>I do my best work mid-morning and super late at night, from one to five in the morning. Some people don&#8217;t need sleep, but I actually need a ton. I just sleep all the time, catching naps in the afternoon or a 20-minute snooze in the office. Our business is 24 hours &#8212; folks in Australia start their day around 4 PM my time and our guys and girls in Europe get going around midnight. Sometimes I&#8217;ll go out at night, come home from the bar at 2 or 3 AM, and then go back to work.</p>\\n<p>For WordPress we&#8217;re trying to set up a community that will be around 10 to 30 years from now, one that&#8217;s independent from the whims of the market. My role is somewhat like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus</a> for Linux or <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Shuttleworth</a> for Ubuntu, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life">affectionately referred to as BDFL</a>, and it&#8217;s my responsibility to meet as many users as possible and direct the software in a way that reflects their interest. Last year I probably met 5,000 or 6,000 WordPress users, about half of them who make their living from it. We want to be like Google, eBay, Amazon &#8212; they all enable other people to make far more money than the company captures. That&#8217;s ultimately what we&#8217;re trying to do, we&#8217;re trying to create a movement.</p>\\n<p>My Mom started a blog a couple of months ago. Six years into this, and we finally made it easy enough for my Mom to use.

I wake up with the sun and do my best to resist the instinctive urge to look at the computer or check email for at least an hour.</p>\\n<p>My vice of choice isn&#8217;t coffee, but <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/03/hoi-an/mcm_2095/">the Kindle</a>. Its electronic shelves are filled mostly with the business books  I read in order to grow up to be a <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/06/23/this-is-serious-business/">real businessman</a> (before someone figures out I&#8217;m not). At any point in time I have about 120 books downloaded. Interspersed between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Drucker</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Godin</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snowball-Warren-Buffett-Business-Life/dp/0553805096">Buffett</a> are classics <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/04/24/on-the-shortness-of-life-an-introduction-to-seneca">like Seneca</a>, which I wish I could read more often but only get to a few times a year.</p>\\n<p><a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the holding company behind <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, finally got an office late last year at Pier 38, a <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/03/wordpress-party-pictures/mcm_4054-3/">beautiful open-floorplan space</a> right <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/3400378403/">on the Embarcadero</a>. It\'92s about a five-minute walk from my apartment, but my preference is to work from home. We&#8217;re very much a virtual company where everyone primarily works from home (or their coffee shop of choice). The half dozen of us in the Bay Area will go in on Thursdays to have a little company, but six days out of the week the space is usually empty. <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/03/wordpress-party-pictures/">But we throw some great parties there</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href="http://ma.tt/2009/05/how-p2-changed-automattic/">The team communicates mostly via P2</a>, something a little like Twitter but password-protected, with real-time updates and threaded inline conversations. P2 is almost like a chat channel, but structured like a blog, and we&#8217;ve evolved to have almost a dozen across the 40 people at Automattic \'96 serving a variety of purposes. We fill any gaps in communication by IRC, Skype, and, in a pinch, <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/">email</a>.</p>\\n<p>In my home office there are two 30-inch monitors &#8212; a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac</a> and a PC. They share the same mouse and keyboard <a href="http://ma.tt/feed/synergy2.sourceforge.net">using Synergy</a> so I can copy and paste between them. The Mac is mostly used for email and <a href="http://adium.im/">chat</a>, while web stuff and coding happen on the PC. <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/">The keyboard is, of course, Dvorak</a>, a more efficient keyboard layout that I switched to 10 years ago. I also have a<a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-16668-Sony+Vaio+Z+Series+(Z90)+Unboxing.html"> Sony Z90 laptop</a> with me all the time, whether I&#8217;m going overseas or just to the doctor&#8217;s office. I&#8217;m pretty rough on laptops, sometimes going through two a year. At home I like to <a href="http://www.qnap.com/">geek out with home servers</a> and networking, and sometimes find myself doing IT support for family, friends, and colleagues.</p>\\n<p>One of my favorite programs that we didn&#8217;t make is <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>. Hackers all know that you have to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProfileBeforeOptimizing">profile before you can optimize</a>, and RescueTime runs in the trap of my computers and tracks how much time I spend on different things, sometimes with surprising results. My biggest time-suck is email, and to help out I wrote a WordPress plugin that filters people into folders based on their email address and priority settings which helps keep my inbox relatively clean. <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Ferriss, author of The 4-Hour Work Week</a>, advocates checking email only twice a week but that&#8217;s too severe for me. I&#8217;m currently trying <a href="http://thepowerofless.com/">Leo Babauta&#8217;s approach from The Power of Less</a>, which suggests small steps like checking email five set times a day instead of constantly. It&#8217;s like dieting: People who binge diet gain it all back. That happens to me with email.</p>\\n<p>Music is my muse and I listen to it all day. There&#8217;s a lot of jazz &#8212; Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins &#8212; but I\'92m also a big fan of Jay-Z, Beyonc\'e9, and Method Man.

We&#8217;ve seen since then a lot of problems with browsers and cookies. To help resolve these issues, and in anticipation of future features, I am updating the plugin and the WordPress.com stats reporting system to remove the iframes. I just posted <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/stats/trunk/stats.php">1.5 beta 1</a>. If you host your own WordPress 2.7+ blog and you use the Stats plugin, why not contribute to its development by installing this testing version?

If something goes horribly wrong it&#8217;s probably a bad download; just reinstall the latest version of Stats.</li>\\n<li><strong>How does it work?<br />\\n</strong>The plugin connects to WordPress.com to get the stats reports when you request them. It uses the API key to authenticate.</li>\\n<li><strong>Aside from fixing cookie problems, how is this better?</strong><br />\\nNow it&#8217;s possible for anyone who can publish posts on your blog to see blog stats. They don&#8217;t have to be logged into a WordPress.com account. They only need the publish_posts capability (Author role) to view stats reports.</li>\\n<li><strong>Where did the dropdown blog switcher go?<br />\\n</strong>Because the plugin uses a single API key to authenticate, the service doesn&#8217;t know whether the visitor is the owner of that key or some other user. So it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to show the list of blogs belonging to the API key owner. You can still use the switcher if you view your stats on any WordPress.com dashboard.</li>\\n<li><strong>Where did the Stats Access panel go?<br />\\n</strong>This is also related to single API key authentication. Maybe in future we will bring administrative access back to the plugin. But until then, we have left the Stats Access panel intact on WordPress.com dashboards. You might want to bookmark <a href="http://dashboard.wordpress.com/wp-admin/index.php?page=stats">dashboard.wordpress.com</a> if you need these features on a regular basis.</li>\\n<li><strong>Will this be a required upgrade?</strong><br />\\nYou mean will older version of stats be broken? Not by 1.5. Later versions may break compatibility but for now you can keep using earlier versions of Stats if you like.</li>\\n<li><strong>What if I install this and still see iframes?<br />\\n</strong>This happens because your server is unable to connect to WordPress.com. I set it up to use SSL (https) in the hopes that most hosts support this. If yours does not work, I&#8217;d like to hear from you and do some testing on your host.</li>\\n</ul>\\n  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=andy.wordpress.com&blog=155&post=259&subd=andy&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 18 Jun 2009 20:37:53 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:\{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Andy";\}s:7:"summary";s:3995:"<div class="snap_preview"><br /><p>At first we thought it was a good idea to use iframes to display reports in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">Stats plugin</a>.

You might want to bookmark <a href="http://dashboard.wordpress.com/wp-admin/index.php?page=stats">dashboard.wordpress.com</a> if you need these features on a regular basis.</li>\\n<li><strong>Will this be a required upgrade?</strong><br />\\nYou mean will older version of stats be broken? Not by 1.5. Later versions may break compatibility but for now you can keep using earlier versions of Stats if you like.</li>\\n<li><strong>What if I install this and still see iframes?<br />\\n</strong>This happens because your server is unable to connect to WordPress.com. I set it up to use SSL (https) in the hopes that most hosts support this. If yours does not work, I&#8217;d like to hear from you and do some testing on your host.</li>\\n</ul>\\n  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/andy.wordpress.com/259/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/andy.wordpress.com/259/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=andy.wordpress.com&blog=155&post=259&subd=andy&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";\}i:14;a:7:\{s:5:"title";s:44:"Ryan Boren: Auto Upgrading to Nightly Builds";s:4:"guid";s:23:"http://boren.nu/?p=1701";s:4:"link";s:69:"http://boren.nu/archives/2009/06/19/auto-upgrading-to-nightly-builds/";s:11:"description";s:1469:"<p>WP&#8217;s automatic upgrade can be used to automatically upgrade to betas and nightly builds for the development branch or the latest stable branch.

I&#8217;ve been listening to a couple of WordPress podcasts recently (<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href="http://wordcastpodcast.com/">WordCast</a>, in particular), and there had been a lot of buzz about some of the <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a> gatherings taking place in various locations.</p>\\n<p>In particular, there were a few complaints that were pointed out (and some kudos, as well), and it got me thinking about things that event organizers might want to plan ahead for when getting ready for future WordCamps. Having been a speaker at <a href="http://birmingham.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Birmingham</a> last year (and planning to do it again this fall), I&#8217;m pleased to say that <a href="http://dresramblings.com/">Andre Natta</a> and his cohorts did an excellent job with that event. Some of that was probably made easier by the fact that it was a relatively small WordCamp (I think it was about 60 attendees). The bigger the group, the harder the logistics.</p>\\n<p>In addtition to WordCamp, I&#8217;ve also attended a couple of other technical gatherings, like CodeCamp and SoCon, so some of  what I&#8217;ll speak to are from first-hand experience. That said, what are some of the areas that an organizer should give particular attention to? Here is my completely unsolicited, backseat-driver&#8217;s list of event organizer dos and don&#8217;ts:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>WiFi and Bandwidth</strong>: Poor internet connectivity is probably one of the most frequent complaints heard at just about any technical conference. Try to do whatever possible to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle your group size. If there are special setup/login instructions, make sure you provide that information to every attendee when they check in. It&#8217;s frustrating to spend the first couple of sessions trying to figure out how to get online.</li>\\n<li><strong>Streaming</strong>: If you can, identify and designate just one or two people ahead of time to handle live video/audio streaming (and perhaps a backup person). Gently remind attendees that if several people are uplinking to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">ustream</a> simultaneously, it&#8217;s going to kill the network connection for everybody. Also, try to reserve good seats for those handling the videography.</li>\\n<li><strong>A/C Power Outlets</strong>: Just about everybody there is going to have a laptop, and will need to charge their battery at some point. If it can be arranged, ensure that there are power outlets available. You might want to procure a bunch of extension cords and multi-outlet power strips. If outlets are in short supply, try to encourage people not to &#8220;camp&#8221; on them for the whole event, and to let others have access. Label your cords so that folks know that they belong to you, and are less likely to wander off with them.</li>\\n<li><strong>Food</strong>: Be prepared to offer lunch, coffee, soft drinks, water, and maybe snacks. Try to find a sponsor for the event who can provide these things. At WordCamp Birmingham 2008, Microsoft sponsored lunch, arranging a catered buffet with salad, cole slaw, and BBQ sandwiches from a local restaurant. However, I&#8217;ll also suggest that you try to have an option suitable for vegetarians, too (something more substantial than an iceberg lettuce salad).</li>\\n<li><strong>Hashtags</strong>: Decide ahead of time what the &#8220;official&#8221; hashtag for your event should be, make it known, and encourage attendees to use that. Keep it as short as possible while remaining unambiguous. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve seen somebody on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> saying &#8220;What&#8217;s the hashtag for the Dallas XYZ Conference? Is it #xyzconf, #xyz09, #xyzconf09, #dallasxyz, #xyzdfw09, or what?&#8221; Also, remind folks to use the hashtag when uploading photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, and while you&#8217;re at it, go ahead and set up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/">Flickr Group</a> for everyone to submit their photos to.</li>\\n<li><strong>Adapters</strong>: You are going to have speakers with various types of computers that need to hook into your projection system. Not everybody has a standard 15-pin VGA output &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface">DVI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_dvi">mini-DVI</a> connectors are also pretty common. Let them know what kind of connector your projector can hook up to, and make sure that they either have an appropriate adapter to bring with them, or that you have one, or that you can transfer their presentation someplace where you can access it. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> is a great resource to be familiar with. Encourage your speakers to upload and test their presentations with Slideshare, if feasible. Also make sure you have a couple of <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus"><span class="caps">USB</span></acronym> jumpdrives handy, for quick, last-minute file transfers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Bigger Is Not Always Better</strong>: As I mentioned before, the logistics get more complicated as your group gets bigger. Big groups are great in some ways, but don&#8217;t feel obligated to accomodate a huge group if you aren&#8217;t sure you can arrange enough resources to handle them. Better to have a smaller, happy crowd, than a large angry mob (c.f., bandwidth, food). In particular, finding a low-cost location to host an event is going to be harder in proportion to the size of your group. But if you can definitely handle a big group, go for it!</li>\\n<li><strong>Diversify Topics</strong>: At WordCamp Birmingham last year, we had a couple of speakers who didn&#8217;t really discuss WordPress at all. One of them spoke about freelance writing, and another spoke about how her doctor introduced her to &#8220;cancer blogging&#8221;. I found these talks to be just as engaging as anything else we heard. Also, for technical subjects, try to have topics that cover begining, intermediate, and advanced skill levels. In particular, one of the podcasts mentioned above complained about the lack of intermediate-level talks. Lastly, don&#8217;t allow too many &#8220;marketing&#8221; talks. Nobody wants to sit through what amounts to an hour-long infomercial.</li>\\n<li><strong>Social Time</strong>: Make sure you allow some free time for people to socialize and network. Another complaint I heard was about an event where there was a video presentation <em>during</em> the luncheon. The attendees were frustrated that they felt obligated to listen to the presentation, when what they <em>wanted</em> to do was to talk amongst themselves. Also schedule short mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks, if possible (don&#8217;t forget that everybody is drinking water, coffee, and soda).</li>\\n<li><strong>Schwag</strong>: Even if everything else about your event is successful, people will probably think it was a little bit lame if you don&#8217;t have some sort of schwag (freebie items). For WordCamps, I believe that <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> helps out with this a little. But don&#8217;t forget to hit up your sponsors, too. They should be happy to provide some logoed stickers, t-shirts, &#8220;stress balls&#8221;, pens, fridge magnets, or whatever. Also see if you can get a few &#8220;big ticket&#8221; items to raffle off at the end of your event. Books, software, hard drives, desk toys, and such make great raffle items. If one of your presenters has authored a book, hit them up for some autographed copies!</li>\\n<li><strong>Thank Your Sponsors</strong>: Make a point to thank your sponsors before, during, and after your event. Point out to the attendees things like, &#8220;it&#8217;s time to enjoy a great catered buffet lunch from Joe&#8217;s Eatery, provided by our generous sponsor, FooCorp!&#8221; Or, &#8220;remember, our bandwidth is generously provided by Own-U-Net!&#8221; (keep in mind that all sponsors are generous).</li>\\n<li><strong>Leverage Your Network</strong>: Personally, I would have no idea where to start with organizing an event. But I know people who do. I&#8217;d ask them for whatever help and advice I could get. And don&#8217;t be afraid to think outside the box. Tech companies aren&#8217;t the only ones interested in sponsorships. Try restaurants, bookstores, local business entrepreneurship groups, colleges, radio and television stations, ad agencies, etc. And don&#8217;t be afraid to think big: as I mentioned before, WordCamp Birmingham had <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> as a sponsor (thanks for the BBQ, guys).</li>\\n<li><strong>Plan Ahead</strong>: Don&#8217;t let your excitement over setting up an event trick you into committing to a date before you&#8217;re ready. I really don&#8217;t know a good guideline, but I would think that you probably need <em>at least</em> 3 months lead-time, and 4 would probably be better. I know I&#8217;ve seen a couple of events announced, then canceled, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that insufficient set-up time was part of the problem. Also, when you get close to nailing down the official date, you might want to see if there are other local or regional events that might conflict with your planned date.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There it is, my armchair-quarterback advice for organizing a conference. Take it with a big chunk of kosher salt, because I&#8217;ve never organized anything like this myself. But as a speaker and attendee, I&#8217;ve seen conferences that were well run, and some that were&#8230; not so well run. Obviously, you want to be in the former category. Out of all of this, <strong>you probably need to consider Bandwidth, Power, and Food to be your Holy Trinity</strong>. Handle those three things well, and everything else will go more smoothly.</p>\\n<p>If you&#8217;ve organized or attended a WordCamp or other technical conference, what other advice would <em>you</em> give?</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 15:30:41 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:\{s:7:"creator";s:6:"Dougal";\}s:7:"summary";s:10562:"<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1150" title="WordPress Wednesday" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2009/06/01/whats-the-buzz">already posted about the WordPress 2.8 release</a>, and there will be plenty of other posts highlighting everybody&#8217;s favorite new features when it officially drops, so how about if I talk about something a little different? I&#8217;ve been listening to a couple of WordPress podcasts recently (<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href="http://wordcastpodcast.com/">WordCast</a>, in particular), and there had been a lot of buzz about some of the <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a> gatherings taking place in various locations.</p>\\n<p>In particular, there were a few complaints that were pointed out (and some kudos, as well), and it got me thinking about things that event organizers might want to plan ahead for when getting ready for future WordCamps. Having been a speaker at <a href="http://birmingham.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Birmingham</a> last year (and planning to do it again this fall), I&#8217;m pleased to say that <a href="http://dresramblings.com/">Andre Natta</a> and his cohorts did an excellent job with that event. Some of that was probably made easier by the fact that it was a relatively small WordCamp (I think it was about 60 attendees). The bigger the group, the harder the logistics.</p>\\n<p>In addtition to WordCamp, I&#8217;ve also attended a couple of other technical gatherings, like CodeCamp and SoCon, so some of  what I&#8217;ll speak to are from first-hand experience. That said, what are some of the areas that an organizer should give particular attention to? Here is my completely unsolicited, backseat-driver&#8217;s list of event organizer dos and don&#8217;ts:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>WiFi and Bandwidth</strong>: Poor internet connectivity is probably one of the most frequent complaints heard at just about any technical conference. Try to do whatever possible to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle your group size. If there are special setup/login instructions, make sure you provide that information to every attendee when they check in. It&#8217;s frustrating to spend the first couple of sessions trying to figure out how to get online.</li>\\n<li><strong>Streaming</strong>: If you can, identify and designate just one or two people ahead of time to handle live video/audio streaming (and perhaps a backup person). Gently remind attendees that if several people are uplinking to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">ustream</a> simultaneously, it&#8217;s going to kill the network connection for everybody. Also, try to reserve good seats for those handling the videography.</li>\\n<li><strong>A/C Power Outlets</strong>: Just about everybody there is going to have a laptop, and will need to charge their battery at some point. If it can be arranged, ensure that there are power outlets available. You might want to procure a bunch of extension cords and multi-outlet power strips. If outlets are in short supply, try to encourage people not to &#8220;camp&#8221; on them for the whole event, and to let others have access. Label your cords so that folks know that they belong to you, and are less likely to wander off with them.</li>\\n<li><strong>Food</strong>: Be prepared to offer lunch, coffee, soft drinks, water, and maybe snacks. Try to find a sponsor for the event who can provide these things. At WordCamp Birmingham 2008, Microsoft sponsored lunch, arranging a catered buffet with salad, cole slaw, and BBQ sandwiches from a local restaurant. However, I&#8217;ll also suggest that you try to have an option suitable for vegetarians, too (something more substantial than an iceberg lettuce salad).</li>\\n<li><strong>Hashtags</strong>: Decide ahead of time what the &#8220;official&#8221; hashtag for your event should be, make it known, and encourage attendees to use that. Keep it as short as possible while remaining unambiguous. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve seen somebody on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> saying &#8220;What&#8217;s the hashtag for the Dallas XYZ Conference? Is it #xyzconf, #xyz09, #xyzconf09, #dallasxyz, #xyzdfw09, or what?&#8221; Also, remind folks to use the hashtag when uploading photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, and while you&#8217;re at it, go ahead and set up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/">Flickr Group</a> for everyone to submit their photos to.</li>\\n<li><strong>Adapters</strong>: You are going to have speakers with various types of computers that need to hook into your projection system. Not everybody has a standard 15-pin VGA output &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface">DVI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_dvi">mini-DVI</a> connectors are also pretty common. Let them know what kind of connector your projector can hook up to, and make sure that they either have an appropriate adapter to bring with them, or that you have one, or that you can transfer their presentation someplace where you can access it. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> is a great resource to be familiar with. Encourage your speakers to upload and test their presentations with Slideshare, if feasible. Also make sure you have a couple of <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus"><span class="caps">USB</span></acronym> jumpdrives handy, for quick, last-minute file transfers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Bigger Is Not Always Better</strong>: As I mentioned before, the logistics get more complicated as your group gets bigger. Big groups are great in some ways, but don&#8217;t feel obligated to accomodate a huge group if you aren&#8217;t sure you can arrange enough resources to handle them. Better to have a smaller, happy crowd, than a large angry mob (c.f., bandwidth, food). In particular, finding a low-cost location to host an event is going to be harder in proportion to the size of your group. But if you can definitely handle a big group, go for it!</li>\\n<li><strong>Diversify Topics</strong>: At WordCamp Birmingham last year, we had a couple of speakers who didn&#8217;t really discuss WordPress at all. One of them spoke about freelance writing, and another spoke about how her doctor introduced her to &#8220;cancer blogging&#8221;. I found these talks to be just as engaging as anything else we heard. Also, for technical subjects, try to have topics that cover begining, intermediate, and advanced skill levels. In particular, one of the podcasts mentioned above complained about the lack of intermediate-level talks. Lastly, don&#8217;t allow too many &#8220;marketing&#8221; talks. Nobody wants to sit through what amounts to an hour-long infomercial.</li>\\n<li><strong>Social Time</strong>: Make sure you allow some free time for people to socialize and network. Another complaint I heard was about an event where there was a video presentation <em>during</em> the luncheon. The attendees were frustrated that they felt obligated to listen to the presentation, when what they <em>wanted</em> to do was to talk amongst themselves. Also schedule short mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks, if possible (don&#8217;t forget that everybody is drinking water, coffee, and soda).</li>\\n<li><strong>Schwag</strong>: Even if everything else about your event is successful, people will probably think it was a little bit lame if you don&#8217;t have some sort of schwag (freebie items). For WordCamps, I believe that <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> helps out with this a little. But don&#8217;t forget to hit up your sponsors, too.

If one of your presenters has authored a book, hit them up for some autographed copies!</li>\\n<li><strong>Thank Your Sponsors</strong>: Make a point to thank your sponsors before, during, and after your event.

Knowing nothing of hair cutting, he felt disinclined to raise objection as Mrs. Thompson removed the large, claw-shaped ''3'' guard from the electric clippers, washed them off in the sink, and then in a moment of transcendental ignorance turned the clippers back on, and returned them to the side of Joey''s head.  "Oh my god!"  She yelped, in a dramatic decrescendo that would have been musically beautiful if it had not signaled the conclusion of what was supposed to be a very normal haircut.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Thompson and Joey\'92s eyes had met in the mirror, a look of honest apology on her face.  Now was not the time to dwell in the past, he had thought \'96 the hair had been cut, there was no use in drawing attention to that very obvious problem.  Better to consider the solutions.  Joey was faced with a difficult decision, with two equally disquieting options \'96 symmetry, or hair\\r\\n\\r\\nJoey could fit three fingers in the scalpy patch.  The eyes of people walking towards him retold the tragedy of what had happened here today, so many eyes that it felt like he had sunburn.  As he passed by store windows he caught glimpses of his new appearance, shifting from bad to worse as he was colored by peculiar shades and shapes of glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hair was now less than a finger width tall, and mapping the landscape of his bumpy head with all ten fingers in the reflection of a Civic''s tinted, lying eyes, Joey tried to convince himself that the combination of what he was feeling and what he was seeing was still very normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is certain weather that doesn''t permit you to feel bad about yourself, at least not for long, and Joey could see he was standing in it. A cool breeze was hitting him about the knees, billowing his jean shorts that stopped exactly halfway down his kneecap.  It had rained while his hair was being massacred, and now it\'92s only parishioner carried it slowly down the rainy sidewalk that seemed without end as it met at the horizon line with the cement grey sky.  The edges of Joe\'92s sandals were wet.  It felt nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning in from the line of Maples that barricaded the sides of Joey''s block like an organic fence, he could see his street was pretty empty.  The only visible anomaly was Tom - he was positioned in a purposely nonchalant stance in the center of his driveway; as if he were a wax statue in a museum of what a casual 12 year old looks like.   As Joey got closer, he could see Tom was wearing a hat with an antenna coming out of the top of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93Hey Joey, what\'92s up man . . .\'94 Tom said plainly, rotating his head quickly towards the empty street.  There was a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93This is a really cool hat.\'94 Tom said with a smile.  \'93It has a radio built right into it.\'94  This appeared to be very true, as Joey could now see there was a blank strip above Tom\'92s right ear, which exposed a tuner and a rotary dial disguised as a useless button.  Tom was nodding his head steadily, and audible was the tiny taps of rhythmic hi hats coming from the plugs in Tom\'92s ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93Do you think it looks cool?\'94  Tom asked.  Joey thought for a moment, and stared at the hat.  Tom\'92s eyes danced nervously at the bottom of Joey\'92s field of vision.  The hat part of the radiohat seemed an afterthought, composed of a false khaki material that could be mistaken for burlap.  It was stretched unconvincingly around a wallet-sized bump on the right of Tom\'92s head, pulling sideways, perpetually cocking the hat at a strange angle that made it appear to be floating just slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93Does it get good reception?\'94 Joey asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93No.\'94 Tom responded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93Hmm.\'94\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93I don\'92t care, I really like it.\'94\\r\\n\\r\\n\'93So do I.\'94\\r\\n\\r\\nTom smiled and nodded, but suddenly his eyes became narrow and distracted, as he clapped his hand over his ear.  Tom smiled apologetically, and seeing no point in out-waiting Tom\'92s favorite song, Joey nodded and continued walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a park at the end of Joey''s street, and he was walking in it, right through the middle in an intentionally unworn area where no bike treads had yet made muddy strokes through the wet, parted grass.  The wind picked up again and blew against Joey''s shirt like an empty promise.  It made Joey feel powerful, but only for a moment, as he noticed a small black terrier prancing towards him, across the park.  Joey had had a dog like this along time ago.  He could only remember him clearly when he saw other dogs of the same breed, it seemed.  The dog was hurtling forward with such bliss that Joey felt he should drop to one knee, arms outstretched, waiting to receive a long lost friend.  The dog skidded to a stop about fifteen feet away from him and ran just as manically in the opposite direction.  Joey\'92s arms held air for a while in case the dog were to look back but he didn''t, never did, and so Joey stood up and picked a leaf off a nearby tree, as if that changed things.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was now walking over a bridge, under which a small river-like event was happening.  It was a poor excuse for a bridge; it held none of the traditional charm usually associated with structures of its kin \'96 it was made of concrete, and had two lanes of traffic heading each way.  The river beneath could have been stepped over, not driven over; that\'92s all.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, when Joey got this far, the bridge was inconsequential; a small seam in scenery where a rip in the rich grass was being pinned back together by an ugly concrete bandage.  But this time Joey was feeling something that could have been described as empathy for the bridge - Joey clasped its cold steel railing in a comforting manner, surprisingly moved by the sudden realization that this bridge was probably just as upset about the whole scenario as he was.  If it was Joey\'92s desire to watch a river flow from a rustic, hidden suspension, it was very likely the bridge held similar aspirations, and was equally disgusted with the rough, formless viaduct it saw reflected in it\'92s pitiful stream.  Joey could see the bald spot on his head from 20 feet up.  He dropped the leaf into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if triggered by this action, rain began to fall and beat the leaf through the surface of the water.  Joey turned and looked upward, catching large drops in his mouth and other areas of his face.  It was especially cold on his bald spot, where the skin was not used to being touched.  Joey\'92s feet made a wet slap, one after another, on the moistening concrete engraved with dates and names; some of contractors and construction companies, some of children who had been in the right place at the right time, another the paw print of a small animal that had not grasped the nature of wet concrete.  Joey wondered if it had been the black terrier.\\r\\nThe sidewalks, streets, and grass slowly filled up in a pattern of dots that reminded Joey of a PowerPoint dissolve transition moving very slowly, as if the entire planet was being dramatically faded into another, darker version of itself for a presentation God was giving to other deities who were interested in learning more about earth.  \'93Now,\'94 God was saying, outlining the planet with an aluminum pointer, \'93it\'92s really wet down there.\'94\\r\\nJoey was helping in the presentation \'96 each stride he took picked up a little water and slapped it down in front of him in a shoe shaped splat.  He could look behind him and see a long trail of where he had been, at least the places the rain had not yet eaten up around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoey often thought of what it would be like if his shoes always left this trail, but didn''t evaporate - if maybe they were bright blue instead, and he could see them everywhere he had ever stepped.  There would be a dense patch on the driveway and sidewalks in front of his house, and alot in front of Tom''s house too.  There would be long, lackadaisical trails through grass of the park, and there would be stray strokes everywhere, where Joey had run out into the street, walked on the seat of a bench instead of the ground, or had forgotten to stop walking and ended up in a new place he had not been before, and would not visit again.  There would be several footprints at the spot he now stood as well, a quaint porch serenely covered by a small overhang.  The ground below it remained completely dry - God couldn''t touch this place.  And after the short anthem of a doorbell ring there was Jamie in front of him, and he smiled as best he could despite himself and tried to remember everything about the bridge and the dog and the rain that he had already told himself was true.  Jamie smiled back.\\r\\n\\r\\n"You got a haircut!" she said, patting his short fuzz affectionately.  There was no point in hiding it, but her pinky found it before he could explain.  She giggled.\\r\\n\\r\\n"They missed a spot" she sang, situating four fingers into the blank patch. Like two flowers peaking through a cement crack Jamie sat beside him, tracing small circles in the absence of hair, on third step on the porch where just their feet got wet.  There was a glimmer in her eye that showed an interest in the sensation both given and received from the tactility of finger on skin.  Circle, circle, circle . . .this time a word.  What was it?\\r\\n\\r\\n"Concentrate!" she insisted, pushing hard on his scalp, tracing the same letter over and over again.  Whatever word she was tracing had to be at least eleven syllables, maybe a sentence, which made sense since Jamie was always saying whole sentences in a word and getting mad when Joey didn''t understand.  She sighed, embracing him, head balanced delicately on his shoulder like a wilting flower. "You were in the hospital a really long time."\\r\\n\\r\\nJoey nodded.  They sat in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nJamie jumped up.  "Don''t go anywhere . . ." she said, running back into her house.  Joey stared nervously at her mom''s flower box, thinking about the difference between planter dirt and the kind his toes were in, until she emerged with a felt tip marker in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n"Hold still."\\r\\n\\r\\nJamie sat down Indian style facing the left side of Joey''s head, placing the marker firmly to his bald spot.  Slowly, Jamie drew a crisscross pattern in it, like a pair of shoelaces jumping back and forth across the space.  Then, grasping their imaginary ends she gave the laces a firm tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n"There, " she said, looping a fake knot, "all back together."', '3 Fingers Wide', 0, '"There," she said, looping a fake knot, "all back together."  \\r\\n', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '3-fingers-wide', '', '', '2008-06-06 02:01:36', '2008-06-06 06:01:36', '', 0, 'http://archecreative.com/story/?p=3', 0, 'post', '', 0);\

The color underneath, he thought, was like peeling the skin off of pudding but beautiful and natural.  And in context also the dirt on top seemed old and useless whereas the soil beneath seemed healthy and new, to the point that if you had seen the two side by side removed from their environment, you wouldn''t have guessed they even came from the same planet, let alone stacked on top of eachother, only inches apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had asked him to come, probably because he was quiet and thin, not the type to be good at sports, so surely he liked to garden.  Really, he had never even considered it.  It had simply never seemed relevant to him, but now as he sifted the dirt through his gloves he swore he could feel a heartbeat.  He took off the gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the earth he dug out was being replaced with was whitish-purpleish bulbs, some with tiny green specks already creeping out the top, like they couldn''t wait to grow.  He considered their shape in his hand, like an organic baseball not yet ripe.  The sun lay stretched out on his back, pushing sweat out of his face like he was doing something heroic or strenuous, when really gardening should not take that kind of diligence.  Or should it?  All sorts of new questions were arising.  To think that each potato, strawberry, and or watermelon he would eat had undergone this delicate birth rite made him want to go home and eat appreciatively.  Now surely as his teeth pierced the skin of an apple he would think of how a man somewhere, sun on his back, sweat on his face, had dropped a tiny seed into a tiny dirt pocket much like his own, praying that years from then someone would be pushing their teeth past that sweet skin and be thinking of him.  Or maybe the man didn''t care what people thought of while they ate, maybe it was just enough for them to be enjoying it.  That''s the type of farmer he would be, if he were a farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n"You''re a natural!", she had said, watching him caress the earth around the tiny tops of the bulbs, so that the little green hairs just poked through the surface.  "Perfect Depth.  Thank you so much for coming."  He smiled shyly; he liked the way she found reason to appreciate him and the way she could so perfectly nurture plant life, like it was nothing.  Just common sense and love.  Appropriate also, he felt, that her hair and freckles should be so similar in color to that of the dirt, only a little more reddish in the sun.  The strands danced across her face in a gentle samba, moved by the deep voice of the spring breeze who still had ice in the bottom of his lungs, making her light skin shiver.  The trees and the flowers seemed to lean in to to warm her, and then as if breathing out they raised their petals and branches like they were beholding a great gift, rhythmic, valid, and lyrical.  A dance.  He wanted to dance too, but dared not risk the awkward moments he would spend as he struggled to match the rhythm everything else was already dancing too.  Instead, he watched closely, placing big black footsteps on the dance floor in his mind, so that when the time was right he could rush the stage, twirling magnificently also, in an Arabesque that mimicked the wilting of a flower.', 'Knowing Nothing of Flowers', 0, 'That''s the type of farmer he would be, if he were a farmer.', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'knowing-nothing-of-flowers', '', '', '2008-05-23 00:34:38', '2008-05-23 04:34:38', '', 0, 'http://archecreative.com/story/?p=6', 0, 'post', '', 0);\

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(13, 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'THE MUSTACHE\\n\\nI recently had a conversation with a female friend of mine about what she finds desirable in the opposite sex.  Sitting at a table in a crowded mall, I would point to random guys and she would give her analysis.  When I pointed to a tall, well-dressed, relatively attractive guy, she immediately said \'93Ewww, no.\'94\\n\'93Why?\'94 I asked.  The answer?  He had a mustache.  When I asked her what was so bad about a mustache she couldn\'92t say, answering only \'93I don\'92t know . . . they\'92re just creepy.\'94\\nIt was true.  As I got a better look at the young man, I too was put off by that mess of hair beneath his nose, and immediately developed a sense of apprehension and distrust.  Why?  I don\'92t know.  Mustaches, especially on guys my age, are just unexplainably creepy.\\nIt is a sentiment I have since discovered echoes through many people my age (early 20s), especially girls.  Many have simply told me they would not trust a guy with a mustache.  So it makes me wonder, am I just friends with strangely prejudice people, or could this phenomenon be proven on a larger scale?  Could it really as bad as it sounds?  Could a mustache REALLY decide that much of your social life, and keep you from connecting with other people?  In order to find out, I decided to live a month in the life of the mustached.  No, not in real life \'96 in a digital life that is much more serious: Myspace.\\nNot only is Myspace set up specifically set up for building social networks, it allows the results of your effort to be visibly seen and calculated \'96 people will either \'93accept\'94 or \'93deny\'94 my friendship.  You can easily keep an exact record of people\'92s feeling towards you.  If you wanted to test your likeability, Myspace was the place to do it.\\nSo this is what I figured \'96 if I wanted to test how people treated someone with a mustache vs. someone without one, I would make two Myspace profiles.  The first would be my normal profile, complete with all the interests, musical tastes and stupid videos that can already be seen on my site.  The second would an exact replica, with one difference:\\n\\nNormal profile                    Mustache profile\\n\\nA mustache.\\n\\nWith a little Photoshop magic and the council of several of my designer friends, I was able to create a realistic mustache.   It went through several revisions while the exact amount of bevel and fluff was discussed.  My goal was to create a mustache that was believable but still strangely creepy, and I feel the end result (top right) was successful.\\nSo there we had it \'96 two profiles with the exact same content, bar mustache.  I even convinced several friends to play along by adding me and leaving realistic comments, as if I was some beloved friend who had at last conceded and gotten a Myspace.  I couldn\'92t hide the fact that I was a new member, but at least I could prove I was not a friendless creep who got a profile to meet small children.  The mustache profile was socially credible.\\n\\nTHE IMPLEMENTATION\\n\\nNow it was time to experiment.  I figured there were several ways of measuring how accepted I was by society:  How many friend adds I received, how many messages were returned, and whether I could get someone to make our friendship public by leaving me a comment.  Thus, I sent out 31 messages and friend requests to 31 different single girls with each profile.  I made sure to choose girls near my age that would be considered acceptable to date, but from very different walks of life.  Tearing through the browse feature I found about 9 basic categories of girls my age, showing characteristic tastes such as preppy, goth, scene, otaku, thug, nerdy, etc; hoping that I would see some sort of breakdown in mustache preference depending on social stratification.  Each message said simply (subject) \'93Hey\'94 (body) \'93What\'92s up?\'94.\\nIn order to better categorize the results, I attached a numeric value from 1-4 to the each person, depending on how much social activity I was able to get out of them.  The chart was as follows:\\n\\n1 = No Response\\n2 = Accepts add but does not respond to message\\n3 = Accepts add and does respond to message\\n4 = Accepts add, responds to message, and leaves a comment\\n\\nMy approach was to wait for a response, then try to be as charming as possible in an attempt to prolong our conversation and increase the chances of a comment.  I may be weird looking (even without a mustache) but I have always proven myself to be a decent conversationalist, and I was counting on this to win me some comments.\\n\\nTHE RESULTS\\n\\nFirst, the control profile.\\n\\nFriend value    # Received\\n1    8\\n2    6\\n3    9\\n4    8\\nFriend Value: 2.55\\n(63.75% likable)\\nOut of 31 girls, 8 did not respond, 6 added me without saying a word, 9 added me and wrote me back, and 8 left me comments.  This gives me an average friend value of about 2.55 - not a bad score, meaning that slightly more than half of the female Myspace population at least wouldn\'92t mind talking to me for a while.\\nThat is, as long as I don\'92t have a mustache!:\\n\\nFriend value    # Received\\n1    25\\n2    3\\n3    2\\n4    1\\nFriend Value: 1.32\\n(33% likable) \uc0\u9785 \\n\\nJust adding a mustache to the equation, with all other variables locked, cuts my attractiveness in half, an average score of 1.32, lowering my approval rating from 63% to 33%.  Forget about social stratification, girls from all walks of life equally despised me.  If you prefer to see rejection in the form of a bar graph, see below:\\n\\nTHE MORAL\\n\\nSo what do we take from this?  Perhaps we can conclude that the average male is at least 30% more attractive without a mustache.  Or, that the average 18-20 year old girl on Myspace is exceedingly shallow.  Either way, I will never grow a mustache.  This sounds stupid, I know, but the emotional duress I incurred while playing this sick charade was actually quite real \'96 after all, it was me behind the mustache - it was my winning personality that was motivating all my messages \'96 so it was hard not to feel a real, if not digital and hypothetical rejection from each person that denied my request.  My mustache profile actually received a message that read \'93u ugly bitch watchu want dont reply\'94.  Granted, I shouldn\'92t have let it, but the mustache got inside my head \'96 where I breezed through charming and flirtatious messages on my normal profile, I somehow struggled to make basic conversation when I saw that glaring mustache on my face in the outgoing message box.  The knowledge that my appearance was somehow blemished beyond my control crippled my confidence, and showed that it\'92s not just the beautiful that use their looks as a crutch.  This might be taking things a little too far out of context, but I feel the mustache is a variable for the other physical hardships that could prevent perfectly normal people from fitting into society - maybe it\'92s a nasty scar from an accident, or a physical disability affecting the way you walk, speak, or look.  In a different time perhaps this was racism, maybe the idea of being unattractive is so permanently rooted in our culture that we don\'92t even feel ourselves using it as strainer to weed out the people don\'92t want to know.  I know I don\'92t.\\nBut if you notice in the data, there was one girl rated a 4 in my mustache profile.  For whatever reason the mustache didn\'92t phase her.  We messaged back and forth, making polite conversation, becoming friends beyond what was required for my data.  She told me stories about growing up in a small town, a scenario I could very much relate too, and when I turned 21 last week she was the only one to wish my mustached self a happy birthday.  Somehow that meant more to me than the dozens of birthday wishes I got on my real profile.\\nI feel like there is more to this study then I\'92ve discussed, but I\'92m not sure I could express it in a bar graph.  Being a naturally cynical person I had fun creeping out young girls, and in a sense took pleasure from the rejection experienced by my uglier self, but I certainly did not expect to make an actual friend with my mustached persona, never expected to be so lovingly accepted in my most unattractive state.  A perfectly normal, sociable girl doesn\'92t care what I look like?\\nI\'92ve written her a message explaining everything.  I haven\'92t heard back yet, and to be honest I\'92m not sure I can expect to.  In the sobering light of newfound friendship what I did was pretty creepy and mean, lying and flirting with 62 girls simultaneously in an attempt to prove a moot point.   If anything I\'92ve only proven myself to be a mirror of the shallowness I set out to put on trial.  But even if that\'92s true, I think I have also proven something I think we all want to believe - that the strainer works both ways.', 'Mustachetrophe', 0, '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2008-10-26 18:50:29', '2008-10-26 22:50:29', '', 0, 'http://archecreative.com/story/?p=13', 0, 'post', '', 0);\

Its more work than normal, but I promise its worth it.  If you could care less about audio accompaniment, The story appears in full below.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom where Chubs was standing, Chris''s bike was gleaming with the same brilliance as the water of the public pool that lay just beyond the chainlink fence it was propped up against.  The frame shined like it had never met the pavement, the wheels a perfect circle, mirror to the divine ratio of the frame - it was everything a Huffy should be.\\r\\nChris hadn''t even locked it up, again. \uc0\u8232         Chub''s swimming trunks were drip drip dripping and making a large splotch on the concrete, growing steadily as he weighed his options.  Chubs didn''t have a bike.  He could see Chris in line to go off the low dive, facing the opposite direction.  \u8232         It was bulletproof logic, really.  If Chris saw him on his bike, he could ride away on it.  Chris wouldn''t have a bike with which to chase him.  \u8232         What Chubs had not counted on was Chris'' older brother Matthew being able to drive, which is how it came to be that Chubs was smeared beneath the front right tire of Matthew''s truck.  Matthew was sent to jail for vehicular homicide and Chris returned to school in August just like everybody else.\u8232         Despite having inadvertently helped to kill a classmate, Chris was still well liked by his peers.  He was amiable and smart, which reflected guilt like Teflon; after all, it was often said that all the intelligence in his family had been saved up for him, and everyone knew that Matthew was prone to solving problems in drastic and dangerous ways.  This would not be his first visit in jail.  So Chris felt virtually unaffected by the event, except for on the first day of school when his new teacher (who didn''t know what had happened) fixed the seating chart so that Chubs was to sit right in front of Chris, the same position in which he had watched him get eaten up by the front tire, from where he had sat in the passenger seat.  "Charlie?  Charlie?" the teacher had called, until someone pointed out that he goes by Chubs and that he was dead.  \u8232         And so Chubs died with the summer, his memory as unassertive as the leaves that now covered the school and the surrounding areas.  They lay there thick and red for a while, but as people treaded over them on their way to here or there, they turned brown and beaten, and blew away in the wind.  \u8232     Still, there was when Chubs visited Chris.  It was usually in the afternoon or early in the morning when Chris had just woken up for school that he would show up.  He would sit on the foot of Chris\'92 bed, not making eye contact, just sort of mumbling in this dramatic, depressed sort of way.\u8232         "So what''s going on at school?" Chubs asked.  "After Jake got his cards taken away, what then?  You never told me what happened."  \u8232         Chris sighed, straightened his collar in the mirror.  "He and his mom had to go see the principal to get them back.  They told him he can''t have them here because some kids use them to gamble.  And since some of them are rare and whatnot kids will get in fights and steal them.  That''s why he can''t bring them."  \u8232         "But he got them back?"\u8232         "Yeah, he got them back."\u8232         " . . . Do you like me?"  Chub''s head was hanging even lower than normal.\u8232         Chris scowled.  "You stole my bike."\u8232         "You got it back."\u8232         "The handlebars were all bent up."\u8232         "I''m sorry."\u8232        Chris left, as he always did, mid-conversation and without saying goodbye.  He couldn''t be late and Chubs knew this, still even sitting directly in front of a clock Chubs seemed to ignore time completely and simply talk and talk and talk.  \u8232          At school Chris was asked to talk to the counselor about what happened.  She was a kindly older woman who spoke slowly and wore glasses.  Around her office was a plush and vinyl museum of various visual aids, spelled out in bright block letters and primary colors.  A dry erase board above her head had a long line drawn that said \'93COMFORTABLE\'94 at one end and \'93UNCOMFORTABLE\'94 at the other.  Along it was arranged several small smiley face magnets.  There was a clock on here desk, but she had turned it to face the wall.\\r\\nChris sat on what he imagined was the only couch in the school.  It looked so out of place on the brownish blue carpet that had been beneath every desk he had sat at for the last several years.  But then again everything in this office looked out of place and and strange, including the woman and her slow, easy voice, while just outside the door he could hear the laughter of a hundred children lining up for recess.  He was getting antsy.  Sometimes he had to flex his palms and take deep breaths just to cope with how slow the rest of the world seemed to be moving.\u8232         The woman asked Chris questions about how he felt and whether he ever thought about Chubs.  He said no, talking and smiling brightly with each answer.  To be honest, he was thinking about him right then; the woman shared Chubs\'92 affinity for neglecting Chris\'92 agenda, opting instead to take the longest path from one end of a conversation to the other.  Even as she opened the door for him, her \'93goodbye\'94 lasted a decade.\\r\\nApparently satisfied with their talk, Chris never had to go back to her office, and took the rest of his recesses on the playground with his friends.  \u8232         Meanwhile Chubs still wandered around Chris\'92 bedroom, measuring the length of the floor from one wall to another, waiting for Chris to come home.  When Chris opened the door he would shuffle quickly into a nonchalant pose, feigning the indifference that he saw in Chris.\\r\\nChris would just roll his eyes.  \u8232         "What do you do all day? "Chubs asked one afternoon.\u8232         "I go to school, what do you think?"\u8232         "Naw, I just never noticed before, how long it all takes."\u8232         "That''s probably cause you don''t do anything all day."  Chris sighed as he retrieved several pencils out of the small pocket of his backpack.  He hoped Chubs would leave soon, he had so much homework to do.  It agitated him to hear Chubs drone on and on about having nothing to fill his time.  "Don''t you have someplace else to go?" Chris asked. "Where are you when you''re not here?"\u8232         Chubs stretched and sighed.  "Don''t really like it there.  Everyone''s alot older than me . . .  its all weird an'' . . . So what did Joey say to Jake''s trade?  Is he going to do it?"\u8232         "Chubs!" Chris shouted, griping the side of his desk in frustration.  "Go away!  I have things to do!"  Chris attempted to catch his breath, closing his eyes temporarily, but when he opened them again Chubs was gone.\u8232         Henceforth, Chris was less hesitant to yell at Chubs.  Every time he did, Chubs would leave.  It became routine.  If he showed up at inopportune times, what was he supposed to do?  Deliver an exposition on what he had done all day, when he would just be asked about it again by his mother at dinner?  There is so much to do in a day without repeating it to everyone you meet. \u8232         For instance, there was the raking of leaves into great piles in the yard.  Though the trees were all but bare and the streets were clean, leaves still congregated on the thick meshy grass of Chris'' front lawn.  So long separated from their host Chris was amazed at the color they still preserved - yellow, orange, dark red.  Deeply interwoven with the grass, they resisted the scratch of the rake.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * * *\\r\\nOctober had just begun, and Chris\'92 mother was preparing to pull out her surplus of Halloween decorations, which included a large orange sack with a Jack O\'92lantern face on it.  When filled with crumpled newspaper the bag resembled a giant, ghoulish pumpkin.  The kids in the neighborhood would come over in the days before Halloween and ask if they could help fill it up - This invariably lead to Chris'' mom putting on the spooky sounds tape and baking cookies while the children crumpled a week\'92s worth of papers and tossed them into an ominous orange half-full skull.  She had never understood their proclivity for what she considered thrilless manual labor, but it was a task she would gladly trade cookies for.\\r\\nThis year was a bit different though, and not just because Matthew was in jail again.  Chris typically talked to all the neighbor kids and determined a day they could come over to help, but she had barely seen her son\'92s friends in the last month or so.  Chris had been spending lots of time in his room, which he had attributed to a larger work load from his teacher this year.  Still the demand did not seem as hard on the other kids, and then there was the talking.  Chris didn\'92t have a phone in his room yet (luckily, his mother thought, he was not yet at the age where a private line was any sort of novelty) yet she could hear him talking.  To someone?  To himself?  His words were muddled and unclear.  Perhaps he was just working out a math problem to himself, was the workload really that much harder this year?  Was Chris struggling with school?  She tapped her nails on the kitchen counter, looking dissonantly at a cookie tray.\\r\\nChris\'92 mom knocked on her son\'92s door, then opened it a peak in a manner she always felt was invasive, but at the same time convinced herself was both constructive and permissible.  She surmised this might just allow her to catch a glimpse of some sort of secret her son did not want her to see, that would be shoved in a dresser door or under a mattress before he opened up himself.  As usual, it proved futile, and she felt guilty.  Instead, she found Chris sitting neatly at his desk.\\r\\n\'93Have you been wearing shoes in your room?\'94 she asked, perturbed by the dark shoeprints on Chris\'92 floor that lead from one end of the room to the other, then gathered at the foot of the bed.  Chris shook his head, apparently incognizant of the wear.\\r\\n\'93I was just wondering when everyone was coming over to fill the pumpkin . . . \'94 she stated hesitantly.  \'93I know there\'92s still three weeks, I just haven\'92t seen Mark or Erin around, and I was just wondering, is everything alright?  Are you having trouble with your homework?\'94\\r\\nChris looked confused.  Of course not,  he contended, producing several A papers from his backpack to serve as examples.  Many of them were marked as being handed in early.  Unconvinced, Chris\'92 mother probed deeper.\\r\\n\'93What about just at school, are you getting along ok?\'94 she stroked her son\'92s head.  \'93Are other kids being mean to you or . . .\'94 she approached the subject carefully, \'93are they  . . . blaming you?\'94\\r\\n\'93For what?\'94 Chris asked, spinning his head quickly to the foot of his bed.  He was panting just slightly.\\r\\n\'93You know it wasn\'92t your fault right?  And that Matthew, and you talked to the conselour and she said you were fine I just want to make sure, honey . . . Are you ok?\'94  Chris\'92 mom smiled sympathetically, narrowing her eyes as if the action might produce X-ray results that would show the inside of her son.  Chris laughed, and hugged his mom.  Fine, he said.\\r\\nShe left dubious but unable to to find another loose corner of Chris\'92 actions at which to pry.  He seemed fine, he really did.  That\'92s what worried her.  The minute she shut the door she could here him mumbling again, and pacing.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * * * *\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the initial discovery that he did not stick around if he was threatened, Chris had yelled often at Chubs and he had dissapeared each time.  Leaves of abscence had become longer.  But each time Chubs returned he seemed a bit different.  Different how Chris was unable to put his finger on.  One day Chris had come in to find Chubs going through the things on his desk.\\r\\n\'93What are you doing?\'94 Chris asked angrily.  He had never seen Chubs touch his things before, move them.\\r\\n\'93Just seeing what you\'92ve got around here.\'94\\r\\nChubs had said this and looked right into Chris\'92 eyes, the first time ever.  They conveyed the howling of a vacuum, absorbing everything, even light.\\r\\n\'93Chubs I\'92m really busy.\'94 Chris insisted angrily.\\r\\n\'93Yeah, you most certainly appear to be.  It seems like you\'92re sweatin\'92 every time I see you now.  I thought you didn\'92t have to work so hard at school on account of you being so smart.\'94\\r\\n\'93I don\'92t, now leave.\'94  Chris could feel his heart racing again.\\r\\nChubs, looking a bit preoccupied anyway, left as requested.\\r\\nHe was gone for almost an entire week after that.  The next time he appeared Chris was almost shocked, but soon assumed the same rhetorical jib.\\r\\n\'93Oh, look who\'92s back,\'94 he scowled.  \'93What\'92s the matter, you -\'94\\r\\n\'93If you don\'92t want me here, why do I keep coming back?\'94 Chubs stated.\\r\\n\'93 . . . Are you asking me?\'94 Chris asked.  Chubs laughed this off, walking his fingers through a deck of trading cards.\\r\\n\'93You make alot less noise there.\'94 Chubs teased.  \'93You\'92re quiet and your face looks all saggy like you\'92re sleeping.\'94\\r\\nChris\'92 heart rate was rising again, but being an intelligent young man it was hard for the frustration to supersede curiosity.\\r\\n\'93Me where?\'94 Chris asked, \'93You mean where you are when you\'92re not here?\'94  Chubs nodded without looking up.  \'93Yeah,\'94 he said nonchalantly, feeding off of Chris\'92 curiosity.\\r\\n\'93I thought you didn\'92t like it up there.\'94 Chris riposted.\\r\\n\'93I met some people.  Smart ones.  They showed me the pool.\'94\\r\\nThe way Chubs had said the - the details were just too surreptitious, Chris could tell, and Chubs hung them over his head like a lamb chop to a hungry dog.  All it took was that hungry look and Chubs divulged.\\r\\n\'93There\'92s this pool.\'94\\r\\n\'93Like the one here?\'94 Chris asked.\\r\\n\'93No, absolutely not.  Well, sort of.  It\'92s tile and concrete, like the one here, and there\'92s lifeguard chairs, but no one\'92s ever sitting in them.  And the water is all black.\'94  Chub\'92s eyes intensified.  \'93And everyone\'92s in it.  You, everyone from school, our teachers . . . thousands and thousands of people, for miles.  You\'92re all just standing in it, kind of floating.  It looks like it would be really shallow, but when I looked down in it I couldn\'92t see the bottom.  It doesn\'92t say how deep it is but it has to be really deep and . . . I can see stuff moving deep down in it.  Giant things.\'94  Chubs shuttered a little bit.  \'93One day I was just sitting there, watching it - trying to see what\'92s in there, you know.  You can make out shapes if you stare at it long enough.  Anyway, I see this really long line.  Looks like an eel, only, Chris, it\'92s so long.  The pool is so big I can\'92t see the other side, but measuring by people it had to be like a hundred feet long.  Anyway I watch it all day waiting for it to swim but it doesn\'92t.  Then I start to notice smaller lines surrounding it, like a wrinkled sheet or something . . . and all of a sudden the lines open and shut, and I realize it was an eye.  An eye Chris.  It open and shut and then sank so fast, like a million feet . . .\'94\\r\\nChris was breathing heavily.  Something about the story felt so true to him, like whether or not this place actually exisited, at least the way Chubs described it, had no effect on whether it was real or not.  \'93What other things do you see in the pool?\'94 Chris asked.\\r\\nChubs leaned in.\\r\\n\'93I started sitting closer.  At first I was afraid, because I couldn\'92t see what was in there, how deep it went . . .\'94 Chub\'92s eyes opened wide like someone had shut off the lights.  \'93But the more I looked into it the more I felt like it was alright and the less afraid of it I felt.  There\'92s fish in it.  Lots of them.  And people too, and objects.  Lots of stuff I\'92ve never seen before.  But that\'92s not all.  I can\'92t describe it really . . . there\'92s . . . things in it.  Things that don\'92t have names or even shapes.\'94\\r\\n\'93How can you see it if it doesn\'92t have a shape?\'94 Chris asked.\\r\\n\'93Well, its not like seeing it with your eyes, I guess.  I just look and think and then suddenly, I see it.  Like a magic eye book where its just a bunch of lines and color but if you concentrate you can see dolphins and clowns and stuff.\'94\\r\\n\'93So, there\'92s things in there that can\'92t be described at all?  But what are they?  Explain it better.\'94\\r\\n\'93I know, I didn\'92t understand at first either.  I was lying on my stomach with my head leaned over the side, but I could still only see so much, you know.  The more I saw the more I felt like there was a whole lot more that I was missing, like this whole time I\'92d only seen one little piece of a giant puzzle.  Actually, the opposite.  The more I look at it the more I feel like I\'92m a little puzzle piece, sitting on a shelf.  But -\'94\\r\\nChris\'92 mom gave a quick knock on his door, then opened it slightly.  \'93Have you been wearing shoes in your room?\'94 she asked.  Chris looked around and Chubs was gone.\\r\\nThe next time Chubs appeared, Chris was in his front yard feverishly raking leaves.  From the window Chris could see Chubs pacing around his room in a distant, distracted sort of way.\\r\\n\'93Still so many leaves!\'94 Chubs said as Chris entered. \'93Even more than the last time I was here I think!\'94\\r\\n\'93Have you seen more in the pool?\'94 Chris asked without hesitation, pulling up a chair.  Chubs nodded and rubbed his palms together.\\r\\n\'93So where were we?  I was looking over the edge was I?\'94  Chubs cleared his throat.  \'93From the edge I could only see enough to be more confused.  I talked to those people I met, remember?  They told me I shouldn\'92t be spending so much time at the water\'92s edge.  You know there\'92s some people up there that won\'92t even go near it?  They say that there\'92s a reason I can\'92t see everything.   But you know, that\'92s easy for them to say.  They\'92re old and they probably think they know everything so what\'92s the point in learning more, right?  Plus this isn\'92t the type of learning everyone\'92s always trying to get us to do, all the facts and figures and who-discovered-America-s.  This is the type of things they don\'92t want you to know about because they want it all for themselves or because they don\'92t see how important it is.  Either way, it didn\'92t stop me.\'94\\r\\n\'93What\'92d you do?\'94 Chris asked, mesmerized.\\r\\n\'93I touched it.  I went right up to the water and I touched it.  At first I just stuck my hand in, real fast -\'94 Chubs demonstrated this with a rapid dunking motion - \'93and just got my hand wet.  I thought it might hurt or stain me because of it being black, but it didn\'92t do a darn thing.\'94\\r\\n\'93Did you understand after you touched it?\'94\\r\\n\'93No, not right away.  I wasn\'92t expecting to really.  I just wanted to get closer.\'94  Chubs smiled smugly.  \'93I knew I shouldn\'92t have, or rather that I wasn\'92t wanted to, but this was too much Chris.  I lowered myself in real easy and just paddled in place for a bit.  I didn\'92t want anything in there to see me or catch me so I took it slow and got out every few minutes.  I could still see stuff down in there, and it wasn\'92t paying me any mind.  If anything it all made room for me, like I was a part of it, same as everything else in there.\'94\\r\\nChris was amazed that Chubs had found the courage to pull such a gutsy stunt.  He had been too afraid to even go off the lowdive.\\r\\n\'93So I sat and soaked in there for a while.  I felt right at home.  So I decided to take it to the next level, and stuck my face in.\'94\\r\\n\'93Could you see?\'94 Chris asked.  Chubs laughed.\\r\\n\'93Could I see?  Chris, I had never seen before this.  See, looking into the pool, everthing was blackish-blue and colored funny by the water, but underneath the surface, it was COLOR!  Color like I\'92d never seen before.  Colors I couldn\'92t think of names for next to ones I can\'92t get enough of.  Some of them, I could stare at and see every shade that it was made of!  They danced around me like I was the beauty queen on top of the biggest float in the parade.  Even the shadows were in color Chris!  It was all so loud and, noisy, none of it made any sense to me but I was so delighted just to see it and be there and everything that I kept swimming deeper and deeper.  I forgot completely that I was underwater.  Suddenly my lungs choked me and I realized I had been under for who knows how long - I looked up and around but everything was so bright that I couldn\'92t see where the surface was.  My lungs gave me one big stab in the chest and I inhaled about a gallon of that black water.  And when I did,\'94 Chubs shivered visibly, \'93everything in the entire pool, in all creation, lined themselves right up and marched single file into my head.  The colors bent and folded and spelled out the whole world in some heavenly language of thoughts and shapes . . . and I realized that I didn\'92t have to breathe at all.  I just floated there, calm and steady as a ticking clock, just taking in this play that was being put on before me.  It was beautiful Chris.  I mean, it still is - everywhere I look now, ever since - I see the whole world from backstage.  I understand.  Does that make sense Chris?\'94\\r\\n\'93Does it ever.\'94 Chris confessed, looking dreamily off into the distance.  \'93I knew there was something like that, I did.  Things get so confusing you know, and I knew that out there there was some way to know, to make sense of it.  It\'92s what I want more than anything right now Chubs.  Can you explain it to me?\'94\\r\\nChubs shook his head.  \'93I don\'92t think so.\'94 he lamented, \'93Like I said, even staring at the pool for weeks I couldn\'92t grasp it.  Even under the surface it was all gibberish in my head.  It wasn\'92t til I drank it that everything clicked like it did.\'94\\r\\nChris was undeterred.  \'93This water then - if I, like, give you a glass - can you bring me some back?\'94\\r\\n\'93Hmm,\'94 Chubs considered, \'93I don\'92t really know.  I could try though . . .\'94\\r\\n\'93Oh, I really want you to.  This means a whole lot to me Chubs, there\'92s been alot of things bothering me lately and it would just mean the world.\'94\\r\\nChubs smiled his dopey grin.  \'93We\'92d really be friends after that, wouldn\'92t we?\'94\\r\\n\'93Yes Chubs,\'94 Chris conceded, \'93Yeah, we really would.  Can you do that for me?\'94\\r\\n\'93Of course, whatever it takes, I\'92ll bring it back for you.  A whole big cup of it.\'94\\r\\nChris made sure that his mother was free from the hallway, and snuck into the kitchen, retrieving a large glass tumbler.  \'93Here,\'94 he said, sticking it firmly in Chub\'92s pudgy hand, \'93My mom really likes this one, so even if you can\'92t keep the water in it make sure you bring this back.\'94\\r\\n\'93Got it!\'94 Chubs said happily.  Chris checked the hallway once again for his mother, and when he shut his door again Chubs and the glass were gone.\\r\\nIt was early morning of the next day when Chris realized that he had never told Chubs when to return.  Would he wait a week again?  Would he get distracted beside the pool?  Chris tapped his pencil nervously on his desk, watching the clock slide slowly into the afternoon.  His heart pounded faster than normal.  Leaving as soon as the bell would allow him Chris ran through the streets until finally he was crossing his own leaf-laden yard.  There in his window, behind the curtains, he could see Chubs pacing.\\r\\nChris slammed the door behind him. \'93Did you?\'94 he puffed, too exhausted to finish his statement.  Chubs just smiled, pointing to a tall glass of black liquid sitting on his desk.  Chris was too enthralled by it to yell at Chubs for spilling some around where it sat.  The liquid made a kalidoscopic fractal of color where it had dried on the desk.\\r\\n\'93Did good, didn\'92t I?\'94 Chubs beamed.\\r\\nChris nodded, lifting the glass.  Grasping it with both hands he brought it to eye level.  Chubs had been right - even in its tiny chalice there was a depth to it Chris could not explain - it was as if the glass were 8 feet deep.  Inside he saw things moving in rhythm, looking up at him, perhaps waiting for him to join in.\\r\\nQuickly, as to block the gut reaction to drinking something so strange a color, Chris tipped the glass back and let the entire cup flow down his open throat.  There was more to drink than he had anticipated, the water seemed to just keep pouring and pouring, so long that Chris felt he might need to take a breath.  Then suddenly he didn\'92t feel like breathing was necessary anymore.  Chris felt the gush end and swallowed hard - opening his eyes.  They had already been open, but now he felt them really open, as if up to this point he had beens starring at the world through a semi-translucent eyelid like an aligator.  Chris looked at Chubs.  He looked at his hands.  He began to tremble.\\r\\n\'93Do you see it?\'94 Chubs asked enthusiastically.  \'93Do you see now what I was talking about?\'94\\r\\nOn the walls all around Chris was written a novel, of sorts - he read it instantaneously in one glance, from the beginning to the very last page where the words overlapped and became the beginning again.  Chris could hear Chubs speaking.\\r\\n\'93Chris?  Are you ok?\'94\\r\\nChris kneeled and slithered backwards until he met a pile of drity laundry stacked in a corner.  He looked up at Chubs, his eyes so wide it was hard to tell their color.\\r\\n\'93Chubs . . .\'94 Chris muttered in disbelief.\\r\\n\'93Oh, I knew it!  You have your answers now don\'92t you?\'94\\r\\n\'93How do you,\'94 Chris mumbled, as he found himself almost unable to speak simply out of the awareness of it, \'93How can you stand it?\'94\\r\\n\'93Stand what?\'94 Chubs asked.  \'93I don\'92t see how it affects me really.\'94\\r\\nChris appeared to be riding multiple lines of thought simultaneously.  Rubbing his hands virgourusly, licking his lips, Chris sough the stable ground with both palms to ease the nausea.\\r\\n\'93Well, now that that\'92s over, whataya say we play cards like I always wanted?  We can split your deck in half.\'94  Chubs shuffled a stack of plastic-coated cards from Chris\'92 desk, cut them in half, and sat down in front of Chris on the floor.\\r\\n\'93Well, I\'92ll let you shuffle them again if you want, so some of the better cards are at the top.\'94\\r\\nChris sat motionless except for the rhythmic bob of his head.\\r\\n\'93What are you doing Chris?\'94 Chubs howled.  \'93Why are you messing with me?  I thought we were finally going to be friends now!\'94\\r\\nChris opened his mouth and gummed the air, ineffectively searching for a sensible string of vowels and consonants.\\r\\n\'93So that\'92s how it is, is it, that all this was you needing something and me having it.  Suppose the only reason I got to come here at all was because you knew I had it all along and now that you\'92ve got it you\'92re not even going to talk to me.  You know Chris it wasn\'92t my fault, how everything happened, and you shouldn\'92t hate me so specifically for it.  No one has control of anything and you should know that now.\'94\\r\\nChubs left.\\r\\nInside his room Chris could hear the chatter of approaching children, talking of who they would be for Halloween and what houses they would be visiting for optimum candy collection.  Sunlight cut angrily through his slated wooden blinds; it was the end of the afternoon, and though night was still a long way off, the sun grew tired and red and hung low in the sky like a sleeping cat\'92s eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust two days before Halloween Chris\'92 mother had resorted to calling the parents of the pumpkin-stuffing children and arranged for them to meet in the afternoon.  Now holding two trays of pumpkin shaped cookies she knocked on Chris door with her foot.\\r\\n\'93Chris honey haven\'92t seen you all afternoon!  Time to stuff the pumpkin!\'94\\r\\nIn the garage stood a circle of folding chairs (with the occasional lawn recliner and bean bag) around the empty pumpkin exoskeleton.  She waved (also with her foot) to the the train of kids steadily snaking into the garage.\\r\\nChris, slowly, opened the door to his room.  Alerted by the sound of a turning doorknob, Chris\'92 mom (with a smile) walked to greet him in the hallway, but instead of her son she found only his casing.\\r\\n\'93Honey, are . . . \'94, though she knew without asking, \'93are you alright?\'94\\r\\nChris\'92 eyes were as deep as the pacific, their aperture as wide as a satellite telescope, his smile as sincere as an Judas\'92 kiss.  His facade fractured with a twitch as he slid past his mother to the open garage door.  Leaves everywhere.  Each child held a handful of dead foliage, shoving it into the still empty pumpkin bag while a dozen or so children gossiped and danced and ate merrily.\\r\\n\'93Your mom said we could use leaves this year,\'94 one child announced hesitantly to the quivering boy in the doorway, \'93Since there\'92s still so many in your yard.\'94\\r\\nChris snatched the orange, smiling sack off the ground - and darting with the ferocity of a feral animal dive-bombed the front yard face first, cutting his fingers on the sharp weeds as he scraped armfuls of leaves into the bag.  Chris\'92 mother watched silently as the sack bloomed into a horrible grimace.  His eyes teared as it stretched; nearly spilling out the top.  Chris cinched the bag with both hands, and for a moment it seemed like he had it; still the face split right down the middle and from the tear spewed a gush of yellow, orange and red leaves that slid around the breeze like a life cut into hundreds of thinly sliced, separately aching pieces.', 'What Happened Afterwards', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-happened-afterwards', '', '', '2009-06-20 22:01:23', '2009-06-21 02:01:23', '', 0, 'http://nickandersonswebsite.com/story/?p=17', 0, 'post', '', 0);\
