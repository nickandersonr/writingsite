There are few things more delightful h than a new discovery.  
The oppurtunity to find what others may already know, but but you were unaware of.
How is life, and the   discoveries of science, religion, and nature any different?  

Ignorance is not what we think

We are all victims of ignorance, ignorance from the things that are beyond our grasp
