Rebekkah, do you remember the dance you asked me to?
we were like two pals
we wore costumes instead of gowns and ties
a mockery of the whole concept
We're not taking this seriously, can't you see
we're not looking our best, 
because what do we have to prove
who do we have to impress?
We danced like idiots
to all the wrong songs
and soaked in the stares
as disco lights painted the gym floor

we held hands
we even
well
when we danced slow once 
My arms tightened a cresent around your waist
Your arms crossed behind my neck
and for a second we were doing something better than dancing
or rather, we were dancing for the first time
our rigid limbs relaxed, our bodies swaying
no longer restrained by schoolyard notions
of what it meant to hold somebody
this wasn't our school,
or even our city,
this was a new place we hadn't been to yet

When the lights came up we released
and like that, whatever magic we had created
that had been pressed between our bellies
dropped to floor and scattered like 
a billion contact lenses, marbles and butterfiles
and I swear Rebekkah, each day durring P.E.
I searched every corner, waved a sock in every rafter
but not a piece was left

I dream about this moment every night
Because I've held a thousand hands since then
felt a million worldly pleasures 
but not one holds a candle to the way I felt
when I our hands cupped so innocently
and your head touched my chest for the first time

I just thought you should know, Rebekkah
