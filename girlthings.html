                        For a while I was trying to date a vegan girl - she was coming over to watch a movie, and eager to impress her, I decided to try my hand at making some vegan cookies.  As it turns out, vegan food ingredients are expensive as hell and only come in life-time-commitment quantities.  After spending about forty dollars on surreal amounts of organic ingredients, I whipped up what actually turned out to be some very decent animal-free cookies.  Unfortunately, the girl stood me up, leaving me with one batch of cookies, and a seemingly bottomless bag of vegan sugar.

                        I'm not much of a soda drinker, but my girlfriend at the time was.  I bought a bunch of her two favorite kinds - Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper - so she would have something to drink when she was over.  She drank three cans and broke up with me.

The library charged me ten dollars for it before accepting that it was gone for good.  Approximately three years later I found it shoved in a crevice behind my desk.

                        She gets really bad headaches when she drinks.  She swears by this stuff, but can't find it in stores.  I literally watched her dig the last bits out of a depleted stick with a Q-Tip.  After the last time she was over, I drove around to about five different stores until I found some, and stuck it stealthily into my nightstand for the next time she spends the night.  That's yet to happen though, and there's no way I'm rubbing chemicals on my forehead.

                        Something else I don't drink - Vodka.  I heard she liked it so I bought a bottle.  She came over maybe twice and both times she was not in the mood to drink.  It takes up alot of space in my freezer.  I tried to drink it and got about halfway through it - I'm just not that into it.
