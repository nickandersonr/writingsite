                        to fall into place - I saw a fresh, new path out of the small town I was in, and enrolled in the

                                As Einstein is frequently misquoted as saying, "if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree,
                                it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid."  Whoever actually said this was probably
                                a first year art student, finally feeling the extent of their own ability.  Though I'm thankful for
                                the many failures that brought me to my life as a designer/developer, I can't say I miss them.

                    <p>
                        But I wasn't ready to admit that.  I held onto my art school ideas as I surfed up Active's career ladder - they were a bustling agency that
                        nearly doubled in size durring my two years there, and I rode that wave all the way from junior front end assitant to
                        <b>Lead Marketing Designer</b>.  I was given what, in retrospect, was an insane level of agency
                        over our brand and many others - and I used it to create some of my greatest creative work to date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, I was still very young and very stupid.  I managed to end my employment in a drag out fight with a creative director,
                        over decidedly art-school principles.  I wanted things my way, the best way, the way it should be - but I had yet to understand that
                        the web industry was one removed from idealism.  I took my lofty aspirations home with me in carboard crate, along with my design journals
                        and company awards, and prepared to rise again.

                        After a month of working til 11pm or later, I formed callouses.  Not on my fingers, or feet, but on my spirit - I saw the deadlines, the stakes,
                        laid out before me like towering mountain peaks.  I had no choice, so I climbed them.  Each time I thought I would fail, but each time, somehow,
                        I managed to scale it.  The reward for this climb was another peak, taller than the last.  I learned to love it.

                        I was told that in a couple weeks my work will have paid for it, as if that was something I should be thanking them for.  Zerista, I
                        quickly discovered, was much different than my last agency.

                        The internet is hard.  Startups are hard.  Walking out of this job, I understood the fragile floor on which most development is built -
                        it changes daily, it needs constant effort, and often times you have to build your own solution.  Zerista was a lesson in gritty,
                        pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps work, and I'm better for having gone through it.  Not only did I learn to trust in myself and create
                        my own success, I learned not to whine when I had to.
